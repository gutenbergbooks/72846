<p><span class="smcap">The</span> American declaration of war against England,
July 18, 1812, annoyed those European nations that
were gathering their utmost resources for resistance
to Napoleon’s attack. Russia could not but regard
it as an unfriendly act, equally bad for political and
commercial interests. Spain and Portugal, whose
armies were fed largely if not chiefly on American
grain imported by British money under British protection,
dreaded to see their supplies cut off. Germany,
waiting only for strength to recover her
freedom, had to reckon against one more element
in Napoleon’s vast military resources. England
needed to make greater efforts in order to maintain
the advantages she had gained in Russia and Spain.
Even in America, no one doubted the earnestness
of England’s wish for peace; and if Madison and
Monroe insisted on her acquiescence in their terms,
they insisted because they believed that their military
position entitled them to expect it. The reconquest<span class="pagenum" id="Page_2">2</span>
of Russia and Spain by Napoleon, an event
almost certain to happen, could hardly fail to force
from England the concessions, not in themselves
unreasonable, which the United States required.</p>

<p>This was, as Madison to the end of his life maintained,
“a fair calculation;”<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">1</a> but it was exasperating
to England, who thought that America ought
to be equally interested with Europe in overthrowing
the military despotism of Napoleon, and should
not conspire with him for gain. At first the new
war disconcerted the feeble Ministry that remained
in office on the death of Spencer Perceval: they
counted on preventing it, and did their utmost to
stop it after it was begun. The tone of arrogance
which had so long characterized government and
press, disappeared for the moment. Obscure newspapers,
like the London “Evening Star,” still sneered
at the idea that Great Britain was to be “driven
from the proud pre-eminence which the blood and
treasure of her sons have attained for her among the
nations, by a piece of striped bunting flying at the mastheads
of a few fir-built frigates, manned by a handful
of bastards and outlaws,”—a phrase which had great
success in America,—but such defiances expressed
a temper studiously held in restraint previous to the
moment when the war was seen to be inevitable.</p>

<p>Castlereagh did not abandon the hope of peace
until Jonathan Russell, August 24, reported to him
the concessions which the President required antecedent<span class="pagenum" id="Page_3">3</span>
to negotiation, the stoppage of impressments,
dismissal of impressed seamen, indemnity
for spoliations, and abandonment of paper blockades.
The British secretary intimated that he thought
these demands, as conditions precedent to an armistice,
somewhat insulting;<a id="FNanchor_2" href="#Footnote_2" class="fnanchor">2</a> and in conversation he
explained to Russell that such concessions would
merely cost the Ministry their places without result.
“You are not aware,” he said,<a id="FNanchor_3" href="#Footnote_3" class="fnanchor">3</a> “of the great sensibility
and jealousy of the people of England on
this subject; and no administration could expect to
remain in power that should consent to renounce
the right of impressment or to suspend the practice,
without certainty of an arrangement which should obviously
be calculated to secure its object.” Russell
then proposed an informal understanding,—adding of
his own accord, without authority from his Government,
a proposal, afterward adopted by Congress,
that the United States should naturalize no more
British seamen. Castlereagh made the obvious reply
that an informal understanding offered no more
guaranty to England than a formal one; that it
had the additional disadvantage of bearing on its
face a character of disguise; that in any case the
discussion of guaranties must precede the understanding;
and that Russell had on this subject neither
authority nor instructions.<a id="FNanchor_4" href="#Footnote_4" class="fnanchor">4</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_4">4</span></p>

<p>The correspondence closed September 19, and Russell
left England; but not until October 13, after
learning that the President had refused to ratify the
armistice made by Prevost with Dearborn, did the
British government order general reprisals,—and
even this order closed with a proviso that nothing
therein contained should affect the previous authority
given to Admiral Sir John Borlase Warren to
arrange a cessation of hostilities.</p>

<p>The realization that no escape could be found
from an American war was forced on the British
public at a moment of much discouragement. Almost
simultaneously a series of misfortunes occurred
which brought the stoutest and most intelligent Englishmen
to the verge of despair. In Spain Wellington,
after winning the battle of Salamanca in July,
occupied Madrid in August, and obliged Soult to
evacuate Andalusia; but his siege of Burgos failed,
and as the French generals concentrated their scattered
forces, Wellington was obliged to abandon
Madrid once more. October 21, he was again in
full retreat on Portugal. The apparent failure of
his campaign was almost simultaneous with the apparent
success of Napoleon’s; for the Emperor entered
Moscow September 14, and the news of this
triumph, probably decisive of Russian submission,
reached England about October 3. Three days later
arrived intelligence of William Hull’s surrender at
Detroit; but this success was counterbalanced by
simultaneous news of Isaac Hull’s startling capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_5">5</span>
of the “Guerriere,” and the certainty of a
prolonged war.</p>

<p>In the desponding condition of the British people,—with
a deficient harvest, bad weather, wheat at
nearly five dollars a bushel, and the American supply
likely to be cut off; consols at 57½, gold at thirty
per cent premium; a Ministry without credit or authority,
and a general consciousness of blunders, incompetence,
and corruption,—every new tale of
disaster sank the hopes of England and called out
wails of despair. In that state of mind the loss of
the “Guerriere” assumed portentous dimensions.
The “Times” was especially loud in lamenting the
<span class="locked">capture:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We witnessed the gloom which that event cast over
high and honorable minds.... Never before in the
history of the world did an English frigate strike to
an American; and though we cannot say that Captain
Dacres, under all circumstances, is punishable for this
act, yet we do say there are commanders in the English
navy who would a thousand times rather have gone down
with their colors flying, than have set their fellow sailors
so fatal an example.”</p>
</div>

<p>No country newspaper in America, railing at Hull’s
cowardice and treachery, showed less knowledge or
judgment than the London “Times,” which had
written of nothing but war since its name had been
known in England. Any American could have assured
the English press that British frigates before
the “Guerriere” had struck to American; and even<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
in England men had not forgotten the name of the
British frigate “Serapis,” or that of the American
captain Paul Jones. Yet the “Times’s” ignorance
was less unreasonable than its requirement that
Dacres should have gone down with his ship,—a
cry of passion the more unjust to Dacres because
he fought his ship as long as she could float. Such
sensitiveness seemed extravagant in a society which
had been hardened by centuries of warfare; yet the
“Times” reflected fairly the feelings of Englishmen.
George Canning, speaking in open Parliament not
long afterward,<a id="FNanchor_5" href="#Footnote_5" class="fnanchor">5</a> said that the loss of the “Guerriere”
and the “Macedonian” produced a sensation in the
country scarcely to be equalled by the most violent
convulsions of Nature. “Neither can I agree with
those who complain of the shock of consternation
throughout Great Britain as having been greater
than the occasion required.... It cannot be too
deeply felt that the sacred spell of the invincibility
of the British navy was broken by those unfortunate
captures.”</p>

<p>Of all spells that could be cast on a nation, that of
believing itself invincible was perhaps the one most
profitably broken; but the process of recovering its
senses was agreeable to no nation, and to England,
at that moment of distress, it was as painful as Canning
described. The matter was not mended by the
“Courier” and “Morning Post,” who, taking their
tone from the Admiralty, complained of the enormous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
superiority of the American frigates, and called
them “line-of-battle ships in disguise.” Certainly
the American forty-four was a much heavier ship
than the British thirty-eight, but the difference had
been as well known in the British navy before these
actions as it was afterward; and Captain Dacres
himself, the Englishman who best knew the relative
force of the ships, told his court of inquiry a different
story:<a id="FNanchor_6" href="#Footnote_6" class="fnanchor">6</a> “I am so well aware that the success
of my opponent was owing to fortune, that it is my
earnest wish, and would be the happiest period of
my life, to be once more opposed to the ‘Constitution,’
with them [the old crew] under my command,
in a frigate of similar force with the ‘Guerriere.’”
After all had been said, the unpleasant result remained
that in future British frigates, like other
frigates, could safely fight only their inferiors in
force. What applied to the “Guerriere” and “Macedonian”
against the “Constitution” and “United
States,” where the British force was inferior, applied
equally to the “Frolic” against the “Wasp,” where
no inferiority could be shown. The British newspapers
thenceforward admitted what America wished
to prove, that, ship for ship, British were no more
than the equals of Americans.</p>

<p>Society soon learned to take a more sensible view
of the subject, but as the first depression passed
away a consciousness of personal wrong took its
place. The United States were supposed to have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
stabbed England in the back at the moment when
her hands were tied, when her existence was in the
most deadly peril and her anxieties were most heavy.
England never could forgive treason so base and
cowardice so vile. That Madison had been from the
first a tool and accomplice of Bonaparte was thenceforward
so fixed an idea in British history that time
could not shake it. Indeed, so complicated and so
historical had the causes of war become that no
one even in America could explain or understand
them, while Englishmen could see only that America
required England as the price of peace to destroy
herself by abandoning her naval power, and that
England preferred to die fighting rather than to die
by her own hand. The American party in England
was extinguished; no further protest was heard
against the war; and the British people thought
moodily of revenge.</p>

<p>This result was unfortunate for both parties, but
was doubly unfortunate for America, because her
mode of making the issue told in her enemy’s favor.
The same impressions which silenced in England
open sympathy with America, stimulated in America
acute sympathy with England. Argument was useless
against people in a passion, convinced of their
own injuries. Neither Englishmen nor Federalists
were open to reasoning. They found their action
easy from the moment they classed the United States
as an ally of France, like Bavaria or Saxony; and
they had no scruples of conscience, for the practical<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
alliance was clear, and the fact proved sufficiently
the intent.</p>

<p>This outbreak of feeling took place in the month
of October, when the hopes of England were lowest.
While Wellington retreated from Madrid and Burgos
to Ciudad Rodrigo; while Napoleon was supposed
to be still victorious at Moscow, although his retreat
began October 19, two days before Wellington abandoned
the siege of Burgos; and while, October 18,
the “Wasp” captured the “Frolic,” and October 25
the “United States” captured the “Macedonian,”—in
England public opinion broke into outcry against
the temporizing conduct of the government toward
America, and demanded vigorous prosecution of the
war.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In any other times than the present,” said the
“Times” of October 30, “it would appear utterly
incredible that men should adopt so drivelling a line of
conduct as to think of waging a war of conciliation and
forbearance, and that with enemies whom they themselves
represent as alike faithless and implacable.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Government hastened to pacify these complaints.
Orders were given to hurry an overwhelming
force of ships-of-the-line and frigates to the
American coast. Almost immediately England recovered
from her dismay; for November 11 news
arrived that the Russians were again masters of
Moscow, and that Napoleon was retreating. Day
after day the posts arrived from Russia, bringing accounts
more and more encouraging, until when Parliament<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
met, November 24, the hope that Napoleon
might never escape from Russia had become strong.</p>

<p>Thus the new Ministry found themselves able to
face opposition with unexpected strength. Madison’s
calculations, reasonable as they seemed to be, were
overthrown, and the glow of English delight over
the success of Russia made the burden of the
American war seem easy to bear. In Parliament
hardly a voice was raised for peace. The Marquess
Wellesley in the debate on the King’s speech attacked
ministers, not because they had brought the
country into war with America, but because they
had been unprepared for it; “they ought as statesmen
to have known that the American government
had been long infected with a deadly hatred toward
this country, and, if he might be allowed an unusual
application of a word, with a deadly affection toward
France.”<a id="FNanchor_7" href="#Footnote_7" class="fnanchor">7</a> America had been suffered to carry on
hostilities without danger to herself, and must be
convinced of her folly and desperation. Lord Grenville
also asserted that the American government
was always hostile to England, but that only the
conduct of ministers had enabled it to pluck up
courage to show its enmity.<a id="FNanchor_8" href="#Footnote_8" class="fnanchor">8</a> Canning, in the Commons,
attacked still more sharply the forbearance
of the Ministry and their silence toward America:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It never entered into my mind that the mighty naval
power of England would be allowed to sleep while our<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
commerce was swept from the surface of the Atlantic;
and that at the end of six months’ war it would be proclaimed
in a speech from the throne that the time was
now at length come when the long-withheld thunder
of Britain must be launched against an implacable foe,
and the fulness of her power at length drawn out. It
never entered into my mind that we should send a fleet
to take rest and shelter in our own ports in North
America, and that we should then attack the American
ports with a flag of truce.”<a id="FNanchor_9" href="#Footnote_9" class="fnanchor">9</a></p>
</div>

<p>From such criticisms Lord Castlereagh had no
difficulty in defending himself. Whitbread alone
maintained that injustice had been done to America,
and that measures ought to be taken for peace.</p>

<p>This debate took place November 30, two days
after the destruction of Napoleon’s army in passing
the Beresina. From that moment, and during the
next eighteen months, England had other matters
to occupy her mind than the disagreeable subject
of the American war. Napoleon arrived in Paris
December 18, and set himself to the task of renewing
the army of half a million men which had been
lost in Russia, and of strengthening his hold on
Germany, where a violent popular emotion threatened
to break into open alliance with the Russian
Czar. December 30 the Prussian corps of the Grand
Army deserted to the Russians; and soon afterward
the French abandoned Poland and the province of
old Prussia, and with difficulty, no enemy attacking,
held Berlin. The interest of England turned to the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_12">12</span>
negotiations and military movements of the Continent,
After January 1, 1813, Englishmen never
willingly thought of the American war, or gave attention
to terms of peace. They regarded the result
in America as dependent on the result in Germany;
and they would have ignored the war altogether had
not the American frigates and privateers from time
to time compelled their attention.</p>

<p>With the prospect of a great trade about to open
with the continent of Europe, as the French garrisons
were driven out of Germany and Spain, English
manufacturers could afford to wait with patience for
better times; but although a nation so long accustomed
to the chances of war could adapt itself
quickly to changes in the course of trade, England
felt more than it liked to admit the annoyance of
American hostilities on the ocean. During the first
few months this annoyance was the greater because
it was thought to be the result of official negligence.
December 30, a merchant writing to the “Times”
declared that “the Americans have taken upward
of two hundred sail of British merchantmen and
three or four packets from the West Indies. Recent
advices from the Windward Islands state that the
Admiral is mortified at the depredations of the
American privateers, it not being in his power to
prevent them, most of the few cruisers under his
orders having been out so long from England that
their copper is nearly off,—so that the privateers
remain unmolested, as they can sail round our ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
whenever they think proper; they are in consequence
become so daring as even to cut vessels out of harbors,
though protected by batteries, and to land and
carry off cattle from plantations. The accounts from
Jamaica by the mail which arrived on Friday represent
that island to be literally blockaded by American
privateers.”</p>

<p>When the press spoke at all of naval matters, it
talked wildly about the American frigates. “Such
fearful odds,” said the “Morning Post” in regard
to the “Macedonian,” December 26, “would break
the heart and spirit of our sailors, and dissolve that
charm, that spell, which has made our navy invincible.”
“The land-spell of the French is broken, and
so is our sea-spell,” said the “Times.” The American
frigates were exaggerated into ships-of-the-line,
and were to be treated as such, British frigates keeping
out of their way. At first, the British naval
officers hesitated to accept this view of a subject
which had never before been suggested. Neither
Captain Dacres nor his court-martial attributed his
defeat to this cause; but before long, nearly all
England agreed to rate the American frigates as
seventy-fours, and complained that the Americans,
with their accustomed duplicity, should have deceived
the British navy by representing the “Constitution”
and “United States” to be frigates. The “Times”
protested in vain against this <span class="locked">weakness:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Good God! that a few short months should have
so altered the tone of British sentiments! Is it true,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
or is it not, that our navy was accustomed to hold the
Americans in utter contempt? Is it true, or is it not,
that the ‘Guerriere’ sailed up and down the American
coast with her name painted in large characters on her
sails, in boyish defiance of Commodore Rodgers? Would
any captain, however young, have indulged such a foolish
piece of vain-boasting if he had not been carried forward
by the almost unanimous feeling of his associates?”<a id="FNanchor_10" href="#Footnote_10" class="fnanchor">10</a></p>
</div>

<p>To the charge that the British Admiralty had been
taken unprepared by the war, the Admiralty replied
that its naval force on the American station at the
outbreak of hostilities exceeded the American in the
proportion of eighty-five to fourteen.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“We have since sent out more line-of-battle ships and
heavier frigates,” added the “Times,” January 4, 1813.
“Surely we must now mean to smother the American
navy.... A very short time before the capture of the
‘Guerriere’ an American frigate was an object of ridicule
to our honest tars. Now the prejudice is actually
setting the other way, and great pains seem to be taken
by the friends of ministers to prepare the public for the
surrender of a British seventy-four to an opponent lately
so much contemned.”</p>
</div>

<p>The loss of two or three thirty-eight gun frigates
on the ocean was a matter of trifling consequence
to the British government, which had a force of
four ships-of-the-line and six or eight frigates in
Chesapeake Bay alone, and which built every year
dozens of ships-of-the-line and frigates to replace
those lost or worn out; but although the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span>
privateers wrought more injury to British interests
than was caused or could be caused by the American
navy, the pride of England cared little about mercantile
losses, and cared immensely for its fighting
reputation. The theory that the American was a
degenerate Englishman,—a theory chiefly due to
American teachings,—lay at the bottom of British
politics. Even the late British minister at Washington,
Foster, a man of average intelligence, thought
it manifest good taste and good sense to say of the
Americans in his speech of February 18, 1813, in
Parliament, that “generally speaking, they were not
a people we should be proud to acknowledge as our
relations.”<a id="FNanchor_11" href="#Footnote_11" class="fnanchor">11</a> Decatur and Hull were engaged in a
social rather than in a political contest, and were
aware that the serious work on their hands had little
to do with England’s power, but much to do with
her manners. The mortification of England at the
capture of her frigates was the measure of her previous
arrogance.</p>

<p>The process of acquiring knowledge in such light
as was furnished by the cannon of Hull, Decatur,
and Bainbridge could not be rendered easy or rapid.
News of the American victories dropped in at intervals,
as though American captains intentionally prolonged
the enjoyment of their certain success, in
order to keep England in constant ill temper. News
of the “Java” arrived about the middle of March,
and once more the press broke into a chorus of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
complaints. The “Times” renewed its outcry; the
“Courier” abused the “Times” for its “tone of
whining lamentation, of affected sensibility, and
puerile grief,” but admitted that the behavior of
the American frigates seemed extraordinary; while
the “Pilot,” the chief naval authority, lamented in
set periods the incomprehensible <span class="locked">event:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The public will learn, with sentiments which we shall
not presume to anticipate, that a third British frigate has
struck to an American. This is an occurrence that calls
for serious reflection,—this, and the fact stated in our
paper of yesterday, that Loyd’s list contains notices of
upwards of five hundred British vessels captured in seven
months by the Americans. Five hundred merchantmen
and three frigates! Can these statements be true; and
can the English people hear them unmoved? Any one
who had predicted such a result of an American war this
time last year would have been treated as a madman or
a traitor. He would have been told, if his opponents
had condescended to argue with him, that long ere seven
months had elapsed the American flag would be swept
from the seas, the contemptible navy of the United States
annihilated, and their maritime arsenals rendered a heap
of ruins. Yet down to this moment not a single American
frigate has struck her flag. They insult and laugh at
our want of enterprise and vigor. They leave their ports
when they please, and return to them when it suits their
convenience; they traverse the Atlantic; they beset the
West India Islands; they advance to the very chops of
the Channel; they parade along the coasts of South
America; nothing chases, nothing intercepts, nothing engages
them but to yield them triumph.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span></p>

<p>The immediate moral drawn from these complaints
was the necessity of punishing the United States; but
no one could longer deny that the necessary punishment
was likely to prove tedious and costly.
February 18 Parliament took up the subject of the
American war, and both Houses debated it. In the
Lords, Bathurst made a temperate speech devoted
to showing that America in claiming immunity from
impressments claimed more than England could afford
to yield,—“a right hitherto exercised without
dispute, and of the most essential importance to
our maritime superiority.” Lord Lansdowne replied
with tact and judgment, rather hinting than saying
that the right was becoming too costly for assertion.
“Some time ago it was imagined on all hands that in
the event of a war with America, the first operation
would be the destruction of her navy. What the fact
had turned out to be, he was almost ashamed to mention.
If any one were asked what had been the success
of our navy in this war, he would unfortunately
find some difficulty in giving an answer.”<a id="FNanchor_12" href="#Footnote_12" class="fnanchor">12</a> Lord Liverpool,
while defending his administration from the
charge of imbecility, tended to strengthen the prevailing
impression by the tone of his complaints against
America: “Although she might have had wrongs,
although she might have had grounds for complaint,
although she might have had pressing provocations,
yet she ought to have looked to this country as the
guardian power to which she was indebted not only<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
for her comforts, not only for her rank in the scale
of civilization, but for her very existence.”<a id="FNanchor_13" href="#Footnote_13" class="fnanchor">13</a> Perhaps
these words offered as good an explanation as the
Prime Minister could give of the war itself, for apart
from the unconscious sarcasm they contained, they
implied that England assumed to act as guardian to
the United States, and had hitherto denied to the
United States the right to act independently.</p>

<p>Both Lord Holland and Lord Erskine gently
glanced at this assumption; and Erskine went so far
as to intimate that sooner or later England must give
way. “It has been said that this war, if the Americans
persist in their claims, must be eternal. If so,
our prospects are disheartening. America is a growing
country,—increasing every day in numbers, in
strength, in resources of every kind. In a lengthened
contest all the advantages are on her side, and
against this country.” The warning lost none of its
point from Lord Eldon, who, always ready to meet
any logical necessity by an equally logical absurdity,
granted that “unless America should think proper to
alter her tone, he did not see how the national differences
could be settled.”</p>

<p>Such a debate was little likely to discourage
America. Every country must begin war by asserting
that it will never give way, and of all countries
England, which had waged innumerable wars, knew
best when perseverance cost more than concession.
Even at that early moment Parliament was evidently<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
perplexed, and would willingly have yielded
had it seen means of escape from its naval fetich,
impressment. Perhaps the perplexity was more evident
in the Commons than in the Lords, for Castlereagh,
while defending his own course with elaborate
care, visibly stumbled over the right of impressment.
Even while claiming that its abandonment would have
been “vitally dangerous if not fatal” to England’s
security, he added that he “would be the last man in
the world to underrate the inconvenience which the
Americans sustained in consequence of our assertion
of the right of search.” The embarrassment became
still plainer when he narrowed the question to one of
statistics, and showed that the whole contest was
waged over the forcible retention of some eight hundred
seamen among one hundred and forty-five thousand
employed in British service. Granting the
number were twice as great, he continued, “could the
House believe that there was any man so infatuated,
or that the British empire was driven to such straits,
that for such a paltry consideration as seventeen
hundred sailors, his Majesty’s government would
needlessly irritate the pride of a neutral nation or
violate that justice which was due to one country
from another?” If Liverpool’s argument explained
the causes of war, Castlereagh’s explained its inevitable
result, for since the war must cost England at
least ten million pounds a year, could Parliament be
so infatuated as to pay ten thousand pounds a year
for each American sailor detained in service, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
one tenth of the amount, if employed in raising
the wages of the British sailor, would bring any required
number of seamen back to their ships? The
whole British navy in 1812 cost twenty million
pounds; the pay-roll amounted to only three million
pounds; the common sailor was paid four pounds
bounty and eighteen pounds a year, which might
have been trebled at half the cost of an American
war.</p>

<p>No one rose in the House to press this reasoning.
Castlereagh completed his argument, showing, with
more temper than logic, that England was wholly in
the right and America altogether in the wrong; the
American government and people were infatuated;
they had an inordinate and insolent spirit of encroachment
and unreasonable hostility; had prostituted
their character and showed an unexampled
degeneracy of feeling. “For America he confessed
that he deeply lamented the injury which her character
had sustained by the conduct of her government;
it was conduct unworthy of any State calling itself
civilized and free.”</p>

<p>Castlereagh’s invective had the merit of being as
little serious as his logic, and left as little sting; but
what Castlereagh could say without causing more than
a smile, never failed to exasperate Americans like
drops of vitriol when it came from the lips of George
Canning. Canning had not hitherto succeeded better
in winning the confidence of England than in curbing
the insolence of America; he was still in opposition,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
while the man whom in 1807 he could hardly
condescend to consider a rival was Secretary for
Foreign Affairs and leader of the House. Worst of
all, Canning could not escape the necessity of supporting
him, for Castlereagh’s position in regard to
America was strong, while Canning’s own position
was weak and needed constant excuse. In the debate
of Feb. 18, 1813, he undertook the difficult task
of appearing to attack Castlereagh while defending
himself.</p>

<p>Canning’s speech began by an argument so characteristic
as to win the praise of John Wilson Croker,
Secretary to the Admiralty,—a man less than most
politicians prone to waste praise on opponents. Whitbread
had quoted, in excuse of the American practice
of naturalization, two Acts of Parliament,—one
the 6th Anne, according to which any foreigner who
served two years in any British vessel, military or
merchant, without further condition or even oath,
or more than the statement of the fact of service,
became entitled to every protection of a natural subject
of the realm. No words could be more emphatic
than those of the statutes. “Such foreign mariner,”
said the 6th Anne, “shall to all intents and purposes
be deemed and taken to be a natural-born
subject of his Majesty’s kingdom of Great Britain,
and have and enjoy all the privileges, powers, rights,
and capacities” which a native could enjoy. Again,
by the 13th George II. every foreign seaman who in
time of war served two years on board an English<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
ship by virtue of the king’s proclamation was <i lang="la">ipso
facto</i> naturalized. Other naturalization laws existed,
guaranteeing all the privileges of a natural-born subject
to foreigners under certain conditions; but the
Acts of Anne and George II. were most in point, as
they referred to foreign sailors alone; and with these
laws on the statute-book Parliament seemed to stand
in an unfavorable position for disputing the right of
America to adopt a similar system. Canning’s argument
on the meaning of these statutes was interesting,
not only as an example of his own mind, but as
the only legal justification of a long war which England
fought against America at prodigious expense,—a
justification which she maintained for years to be
sound.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“My construction of the Acts of Anne was altogether
different,” said Canning in reply to these quotations.
“I understood that by it this country professed to give
that only which it is competent to bestow without interfering
in any degree with the rights or claims of other
Powers; that it imparted to foreigners on certain conditions
certain municipal privileges, but leaves untouched
and unimpaired their native allegiance.... The enactments
of this statute are a testimony of national gratitude
to brave men of whatever country who may lend
their aid in fighting the battles of Great Britain, but not
an invitation to them to abandon the cause of their own
country when it may want their aid; not an encouragement
to them to deny or to undervalue the sacred and
indestructible duty which they owe to their own sovereign
and to their native soil.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span></p>

<p>Something peculiarly sacred must have inhered in
the statute of Anne which thus conferred naturalization
on Dutch or Swedish seamen as “a testimony
of national gratitude” for “fighting the battles of
Great Britain” for two years in the British merchant
service in time of peace, and converted them into
citizens enjoying “all the privileges, powers, rights,
and capacities” of natural-born subjects of Great
Britain, which consisted, according to Canning, only
in “certain municipal privileges” in England, subject
to the will of a foreign sovereign. Such a definition
of the “privileges, powers, rights, and capacities”
of a natural-born subject of his Majesty’s kingdom of
Great Britain seemed new to American lawyers; but
it was received with applause by the House, and was
further developed by Croker, who laid down the principle,
new to the popular view of England’s pride,
that the naturalized citizen, who was by the law required
“to all intents and purposes” to “be deemed
and taken to be a natural-born subject,” was in fact
by the Admiralty “considered as having two countries,—the
voluntary service of the one being looked
upon as unable to debar the natural allegiance to
the other.”</p>

<p>The rest of Canning’s speech consisted in defence
of impressment and of paper blockades, and in panegyric
upon European republics at the expense of “the
hard features of transatlantic democracy.” While
assailing the British government because “the arm
which should have launched the thunderbolt was occupied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
in guiding the pen,” he expressed his devout
wish that the war might not be concluded until
England had smothered in victories the disasters to
which she was so little habituated. If an harangue
of this character served in any degree to guide or
aid the councils of England, it served much more
effectually the war-party of America, where Canning
was held in singular antipathy, and where every admission
he made in regard to “the shock of consternation”
caused by the American frigates gave
pleasure more acute than any pain his sarcastic
phrases could thenceforward inflict.</p>

<p>Alexander Baring spoke with his usual good sense,
pointing out that Castlereagh’s speech proved chiefly
the greater interest of England to call for and court
negotiation on the subject of impressments. Whitbread
challenged public opinion by going to the verge
of actual sympathy with America. The debate ended
in an unopposed vote for a vigorous prosecution of
the war, leaving the subject in truth untouched, except
that England had avowed an extreme desire
to punish America, and naturally felt an extreme
irritation because America showed ability to bear
punishment.</p>

<p>The spring came, bringing no new prospects. England
refused to make a suggestion on which the
governments could discuss terms of peace. She refused
even to think upon the problem, but massed
a huge armament in Chesapeake Bay and Delaware
River to restore her naval invincibility. Yet reflection<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
seemed still to be silently at work, for, March
22, the “Times” interrupted its outcry over the loss
of the “Java” by publishing a temperate article on
the new Foreign Seamen Bill of Congress,—an article
in which the suggestion first appeared that peace
might after all be restored by simply omitting in the
pacification any mention of impressment. The idea
found support nowhere; but while, insufficient as it
seemed, the human imagination could hardly conceive
of any other expedient, at the same moment
the uselessness of trying to obtain peace on any
terms was made clear by the interference of the
Russian Czar.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_II"><span id="toclink_26"></span>CHAPTER II.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Napoleon</span> declared war against Russia June 22,
four days after the American declaration against
England; crossed the Niemen June 24, and August 1
was already at Vitebsk, about three hundred miles
south of St. Petersburg, and about equally distant
from the frontier and from Moscow. There, in the
heart of Russia, he paused to collect his strength for
some blow that should lay the Russian empire at
his feet; and while he hesitated, the Czar, August 3,
returned to his capital to wait. At that moment
the chances of war favored Napoleon. Nothing was
more likely than his success in destroying the Russian
army, and in dictating terms of peace in St.
Petersburg.</p>

<p>News of the American declaration of war reached
St. Petersburg August 6, and added a new anxiety to
the overburdened mind of Alexander. The American
minister at that court found himself in a delicate
position. His Government declared war against
England and became for military purposes an ally
of France at the moment when Russia entered into
formal alliance with England and went to war with
France. If Napoleon caught and crushed the Russian<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
army and marched on St. Petersburg, the American
minister would certainly be no favorite with Russians;
if Napoleon were beaten, the American minister
need expect no consideration, for in that case
every influence at the Russian Court was certain to
be English, and from England could come no favors.</p>

<p>At the moment when Brock, with his force of a
few hundred men attacked Detroit, Napoleon with
two hundred thousand men moved upon Smolensk
and the Russian army. August 15, he celebrated his
fête-day on the banks of the Dnieper; and while Hull
was surrendering the fort of Detroit, the Russian
army, hardly in better humor than the Ohio militia,
were preparing to abandon Smolensk to save themselves
from Hull’s fate. Napoleon took possession
of the town August 18, but failed to destroy the
Russian army, and then, turning away from St.
Petersburg, pursued his retreating enemy toward
Moscow. The battle of Borodino, or Moscowa, followed,
September 6, and the French army entered
Moscow September 14. There it remained more
than a month.</p>

<p>During these weeks of alarm and incessant fighting,
the Czar still found time to think of American affairs.
The influence of Count Roumanzoff, though lessening
every day, still controlled the regular course of foreign
relations. September 21 Roumanzoff sent for
Adams, and said that the Emperor had been much
concerned to find the interests of his subjects defeated
and lost by the new war, and it had occurred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
to him that perhaps an arrangement might be more
easily made by an indirect than by a direct negotiation:
he wished to know whether an offer of mediation
on his part would meet with any difficulty on
the part of the United States.<a id="FNanchor_14" href="#Footnote_14" class="fnanchor">14</a> Adams replied that
his Government could not fail to consider it as a
new evidence of the Czar’s friendship, but suggested
that there was a third party to be consulted,—the
British government. Roumanzoff answered that he
had already sounded the British minister, who had
written to Lord Castlereagh on the subject.</p>

<p>The British minister, lately arrived in Russia, was
not a person calculated to aid Roumanzoff. Lord
Cathcart, who had been chosen by Castlereagh for
the post of ambassador at St. Petersburg, was best
known as the commander of the Copenhagen expedition
in 1807. Some Americans might perhaps
remember that he had served in America during the
Revolutionary War. A well-informed writer in the
London “Times,” who belonged to the Wellesley interest,
seemed to doubt Lord Cathcart’s qualifications
for his new post. “He is only better fitted for
it than the horse he rides,” was the criticism;<a id="FNanchor_15" href="#Footnote_15" class="fnanchor">15</a> but
the better he had been fitted for it, the worse he would
have suited Roumanzoff’s purpose, for his first object
could be no other than to overthrow Roumanzoff and
thwart his policy. No serious support of Russian
mediation could be expected from him. He began his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
career by seeking access to the Emperor through other
channels than the chancellor.<a id="FNanchor_16" href="#Footnote_16" class="fnanchor">16</a></p>

<p>Adams, September 30, advised his Government of
the Czar’s proposed mediation. October 15, Roumanzoff
announced that his proposal was ready, and
would be sent at once to Washington,—which was
actually done, before receiving a reply from London.
The step could hardly please the British government;
but Roumanzoff seemed almost to take pleasure in
disregarding England, and perhaps felt that the
course of events must either remove him entirely
from the government, or make him independent of
British support. He clung to the American mediation
as the last remnant of his anti-British policy.</p>

<p>The British government would have preferred to
make no answer to the Russian offer of mediation.
To English statesmen the idea was absurd that England
could allow Russia, more than France or the
United States themselves, to mediate on blockade
and impressment, or upon points of neutrality in
any form; but Castlereagh had every reason to
conciliate the Czar, and rather than flatly reject a
suggestion from such a source, he replied that he
thought the time had not yet come, and that the
offer would not be accepted by America.<a id="FNanchor_17" href="#Footnote_17" class="fnanchor">17</a> So it
happened that the offer of Russian mediation went
to America without positive objection from England,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
finding its way slowly across the Atlantic during the
winter months.</p>

<p>With it went the tale of Napoleon’s immense disaster.
October 23 he began his retreat; November
23 he succeeded in crossing the Beresina and escaping
capture; December 5 he abandoned what was
still left of his army; and December 19, after travelling
secretly and without rest across Europe, he
appeared suddenly in Paris, still powerful, but in
danger. Nothing could be better calculated to support
the Russian mediation in the President’s mind.
The possibility of remaining without a friend in the
world while carrying on a war without hope of success,
gave to the Czar’s friendship a value altogether
new.</p>

<p>Other news crossed the ocean at the same time, but
encouraged no hope that England would give way.
First in importance, and not to be trifled with, was
the British official announcement, dated December
26, 1812, of the blockade of the Chesapeake and
Delaware. Americans held that this blockade was
illegal,<a id="FNanchor_18" href="#Footnote_18" class="fnanchor">18</a>—a blockade of a coast, not of a port; a
paper-blockade, one of the grievances against which
the war was waged; but whatever they might choose
to call it, they could not successfully disprove its
efficiency, or deny that it made Chesapeake Bay, Delaware
River, and the Vineyard Sound little better than
British waters. Export of American produce from
the Chesapeake and Delaware ceased.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span></p>

<p>The blockade, though serious beyond all other
military measures, roused less attention and less
protest than another measure of the British government
which had the character of a profitable insult.
A circular dated November 9, addressed to
the governors of West Indian colonies by the British
government, authorized them to issue licenses for
importation of necessary supplies during the war,—a
precaution commonly taken to meet the risk of
famine in those regions. The Governor of the Bermudas,
in issuing a proclamation January 14, 1813,
published the circular, which contained one unusual
<span class="locked">provision:<a id="FNanchor_19" href="#Footnote_19" class="fnanchor">19</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Whatever importations are proposed to be made, under
the order, from the United States of America, should
be by your licenses confined to the ports in the Eastern
States exclusively, unless you have reason to suppose that
the object of the order would not be fulfilled if licenses
are not also granted for the importations from the other
ports in the United States.”</p>
</div>

<p>Probably the discrimination was intended, like the
exemption from blockade, as a favor to New England,
and must have been meant to be more or less secret,
since publication was likely to counteract its effect;
but in time of war the British government was at
liberty to seek supplies where it chose.</p>

<p>Madison thought differently. He sent to Congress,
February 24, 1813, a special Message expressing indignation
at the conduct of England.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The policy now proclaimed to the world,” he charged,
“introduces into her modes of warfare a system equally
distinguished by the deformity of its features and the depravity
of its character,—having for its object to dissolve
the ties of allegiance and the sentiments of loyalty
in the adversary nation, and to seduce and separate its
component parts the one from the other. The general
tendency of these demoralizing and disorganizing contrivances
will be reprobated by the civilized world.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although many persons shared Madison’s view of
war as a compulsory process of international law,
Federalists and Republicans were at a loss to understand
his view of “deformity” and “depravity” in
modes of warfare. The whole truth in regard to
West and East Florida was not known, but so much
was notorious, even in 1811, as to warrant the British
minister in protesting “against an attempt so
contrary to every principle of public justice, faith, and
national honor.”<a id="FNanchor_20" href="#Footnote_20" class="fnanchor">20</a> What the United States could do
in Florida in time of peace, England could surely
do in Massachusetts in time of war; but if England’s
conduct was in reality deformed and depraved, as
charged, the celebrated proclamation of William Hull
to the Canadians in 1812, inviting them to quit their
allegiance and to “choose wisely” the side of the
United States, should have been previously disavowed
by the United States government. No little ridicule
was caused by the contrast between Madison’s attitude
toward Canada and his denunciation of England’s
attitude toward Massachusetts.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span></p>

<p>Taken together, the news from Europe in the last
days of winter gave ground for deep reflection. With
the overthrow of Napoleon’s authority and the close
alliance between Great Britain and Russia, the last
chance of forcing concessions from England vanished.
A long war, with no prospect of success, lay before
the United States. New York harbor, the Delaware
River, and Chesapeake Bay were already so nearly
closed to commerce as to foreshadow complete stoppage;
and if Boston was still open, its privileges
must soon cease unless Great Britain deliberately
intended to regard New England as neutral. All
this, though alarming enough, might be met with
courage; but against the pronounced disaffection of
Massachusetts and Connecticut no defence existed;
and whenever those States should pass from stolid
inertia into the stage of active resistance to the war,
the situation would become hopeless. Under such
circumstances England would have a strong motive
for refusing peace on any terms.</p>

<p>The shadow of these fears lay over the Inaugural
Address which the President pronounced March 4,
1813, after taking for a second time the oath of
office at the Capitol. His speech contained only the
defence of a war that needed no defence, and complaints
against England which were drowned in the
tumult of war, the loudest complaint that man could
make. Every tone showed that Madison felt doubtful
of support, and that in proving the war to be
just he betrayed consciousness that it was not energetic.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
Perhaps the most characteristic sentence in
the Address was that in which he congratulated the
country “with a proud satisfaction,” that in carrying
on the war, “no principle of justice or honor, no usage
of civilized nations, no precept of courtesy or humanity,
have been infringed; the war has been waged on
our part with scrupulous regard to all these relations,
and in a spirit of liberality which was never surpassed.”
Madison’s phrases were the more remarkable
because at about the same time the British
government announced its intention of making America
feel what war meant. The courtesy and humanity
of the war were to be all on the American side;
while not a word in the Inaugural Address gave the
pledge which could win victories,—the assurance
that the President himself had energy and meant
to exert it.</p>

<p>Besides the alarming difficulties which rose partly
from failure of military calculations at home and
abroad, but chiefly from want of national experience
in the business of war, other annoyances surrounded
the President, and could not fail to make him wish
for peace. Armstrong had not been six weeks in
the War Department before he set the members of
Administration at odds. The factious days of Robert
Smith returned, and the President found the task of
maintaining discipline as great in the Cabinet as it
was in the army. One of the strongest characters
called into prominence by the war, who was himself
destined to have charge of the War Department,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
spoke of Armstrong, four months later, in language
hinting impatient consciousness of something too
complicated to describe. “And Armstrong!—he
was the devil from the beginning, is now, and ever
will be.”<a id="FNanchor_21" href="#Footnote_21" class="fnanchor">21</a> Only by studying what Armstrong did,
could the causes be understood of the passion which
he excited in every man he crossed.</p>

<p>Monroe was the first to resent Armstrong’s proceedings.
Monroe’s character, the opposite of Armstrong’s,
was transparent; no one could mistake his
motives, except by supposing them to be complex;
and in his relations with Armstrong his motives were
simpler than usual, for Armstrong’s views could not
be carried into effect without loss of pride to Monroe.
Already Monroe had surrendered the War Department
to him, with the expectation that if any one was
to have general command of the armies in the field,
Monroe was to be the man. Down to the time when
Armstrong took control, the idea was universal that
the next campaign was to be fought by Monroe.
Jan. 13, 1813, Serurier wrote to his Government:<a id="FNanchor_22" href="#Footnote_22" class="fnanchor">22</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is much talk of Mr. Monroe for the command
of the army, and he has shown a zeal in organizing his
Department which tends to confirm me in that belief....
Mr. Monroe is not a brilliant man, and no one expects to
find a great captain in him; but he served through the
War of Independence with much bravery under the orders
and by the side of Washington. He is a man of great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
good sense, of the most austere honor, the purest patriotism,
and the most universally admitted integrity. He
is loved and respected by all parties, and it is believed
that he would soon gain the hearts of all his officers and
soldiers. He would be given a staff as good as possible,
and with this assistance as well as all his own recognized
resources, it is believed that he would be perfectly suited
to carry on the campaign about to open against the last
continental possession of England in America.”</p>
</div>

<p>As acting Secretary of War, Monroe had urged
Congress to increase the number of major-generals;
and after Armstrong took charge of the Department
Congress passed the Act of February 24, 1813, authorizing
the increase. February 27 the nominations
were sent to the Senate. In a letter to Jefferson,
Monroe told the <span class="locked">story:<a id="FNanchor_23" href="#Footnote_23" class="fnanchor">23</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the day that the nomination of these officers was
made to the Senate the President sent for me and stated
that the Secretary of War had placed me in his list
of major-generals, at their head, and wished to know
whether I would accept the appointment, intimating that
he did not think I ought to do it, nor did he wish me to
leave my present station. I asked where I was to serve.
He supposed it would be with the Northern army under
General Dearborn. I replied that if I left my present
office for such a command it would be inferred that I had
a passion for military life, which I had not; that in such
a station I could be of no service in any view to the
general cause or to military operations, even perhaps
with the army in which I might serve; that with a view
to the public interest the commander ought to receive all<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the support which the government could give him, and by
accepting the station proposed, I might take from General
Dearborn without aiding the cause by anything that I
might add. I stated, however, that the grade made no
difficulty with me, a desire to be useful being my only
object; and that if the command was given me even
with a lower grade than that suggested, admitting the
possibility, I would accept it. The difficulty related to
General Dearborn, who could not well be removed to an
inactive station.”</p>
</div>

<p>Monroe said, in effect, that he would have the
command in chief or nothing. Armstrong said, in
effect, that he meant to be commander-in-chief himself.
The new major-generals were James Wilkinson,
Wade Hampton, William R. Davy of South Carolina,
Morgan Lewis of New York, William Henry Harrison
of Indiana Territory, and Aaron Ogden of New Jersey.
The command of the Northern army was left
to Dearborn, and as the world knew Dearborn’s incompetence
to conduct a campaign, no one was surprised
to learn that Armstrong meant to conduct it
as Secretary of War, at the army headquarters in
the field, performing the duties of lieutenant-general.</p>

<p>No sooner was Monroe satisfied that Armstrong
meant to follow this course than he took the unusual
step of writing to the President a formal remonstrance
against his colleague’s supposed plan. The
act appointing six major-generals was approved February
24. The same evening Monroe had a conversation
on the subject with the President, and the next
day, February 25, submitted the substance of his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
remarks in writing.<a id="FNanchor_24" href="#Footnote_24" class="fnanchor">24</a> His argument chiefly regarded
the inconvenience and unconstitutionality of separating
the War Department from the President and of
mixing military with civil <span class="locked">functions:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“As soon as General Armstrong took charge of the
Department at War, I thought I saw his plan; that is,
after he had held it a few days. I saw distinctly that he
intended to have no grade in the army which should be
competent to a general control of military operations;
that he meant to keep the whole in his own hands; that
each operation should be distinct and separate, with distinct
and separate objects, and of course to be directed
by himself, not simply in outline but in detail. I anticipated
mischief from this, because I knew that the movements
could not be directed from this place. I did not
then anticipate the remedy which he had in mind.”</p>
</div>

<p>From that moment began a feud between the two
Cabinet ministers. The cause was obvious. Armstrong
had found that if a general command were
to be created, it must be given to Monroe. Probably
he felt no more confidence in Monroe’s military
abilities than in those of Dearborn; but determined
that his hand should not be thus forced, Armstrong
decided to retain Dearborn, although his opinion of
Dearborn, as shown afterward,<a id="FNanchor_25" href="#Footnote_25" class="fnanchor">25</a> made the retention
an act of grave responsibility. The decision once
taken, he had no choice but to supply Dearborn’s
wants by his own presence with the army,—a course<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
certain to challenge attack from all Virginia. Had
Armstrong been bent on destroying his rival by
means which the world could have found no chance
to oppose or criticise, he would have removed Dearborn,
and would have sent Monroe to waste his
reputation in the task of conquering and holding
Canada. The retention of Dearborn was an unfortunate
beginning for the new Secretary of War.</p>

<p>The first effect of Armstrong’s administration was
to turn Monroe into a vindictive enemy; the second
was to alienate Gallatin. Of all the old Republican
leaders, Gallatin cared least for office and most for
consistency. Under any reasonable distribution of
party favors, the Presidency should have fallen to
him after Madison, not only because he was the fittest
man, the oldest, ablest, and most useful member of
the Executive government, but also because he represented
Pennsylvania; and if any State in the Union
had power to select a President, it was she. Madison
would have been glad to secure for Gallatin the succession;
he had no special love or admiration for
Monroe, while his regard for Gallatin was strong and
constant; but Pennsylvania cared more for interests
than for men, while Virginia cared so much for men
that she became prodigal of interests. Pennsylvania
allowed Virginia, through the agency of William B.
Giles, Samuel Smith, and Michael Leib, to thrust
Gallatin aside and to open the path for a third
Virginian at the risk of the Union itself. Gallatin,
too proud to complain, had no longer an object of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span>
ambition; and from the moment ambition ceased
abstract ideas of duty alone remained to counteract
the disgusts of disappointment.</p>

<p>Gallatin’s abstract ideas were those of 1801,—simplicity,
economy, and purity. Financiering—the
providing of money for wasteful expenditure—was
his abhorrence. “I cannot consent to act the part
of a mere financier,” he wrote to Jefferson in 1809;<a id="FNanchor_26" href="#Footnote_26" class="fnanchor">26</a>
“to become a contriver of taxes, a dealer of loans,
a seeker of resources for the purpose of supporting
useless baubles, of increasing the number of idle and
dissipated members of the community, of fattening
contractors, pursers, and agents, and of introducing
in all its ramifications that system of patronage,
corruption, and rottenness which you so justly execrate.”
These words were meant to apply only to
a state of peace, but they applied equally well to a
state of war from the moment war became useless.
In the beginning of Madison’s second term, no man
of intelligence denied that the war had failed; that
its avowed objects could not be gained; that every
month of war increased the danger of disunion,
brought national bankruptcy nearer, and fastened
habits of extravagance and corruption on the country.
From his post at the Treasury, Gallatin could see
better than most men the dangers, both financial and
political, engendered by the war, while his acquaintance
with European affairs showed him the need of
rapid diplomacy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Armstrong represented everything antagonistic to
Gallatin; his methods were arbitrary and underhand;
his political training was that of the New York school,
tempered by personal contact with the court of
Napoleon; from him economy could hardly be expected.
Yet perhaps the worst feature of his administration
was likely to be his use of patronage.
The number of Gallatin’s personal enemies was small,
and the use of patronage in a way that would outrage
him seemed difficult; yet within a few weeks
Armstrong offended him deeply. March 18, 1813,
William Duane, of the “Aurora” newspaper, was
appointed to the post of adjutant-general. The appointment
was improper, and the motives to which
it was sure to be attributed made it more scandalous
than the unfitness of the person made it harmful to
the service. Gallatin’s anger was deep: “Duane’s
last appointment has disgusted me so far as to make
me desirous of not being any longer associated with
those who have appointed him.”<a id="FNanchor_27" href="#Footnote_27" class="fnanchor">27</a></p>

<p>Into this embroglio of national and personal difficulties
Daschkoff, the Russian <i lang="fr">chargé</i> at Washington,
suddenly dropped the Czar’s offer to mediate a peace.
Of its prompt acceptance, under such circumstances,
no one could doubt, and on this point the Administration
was united. Daschkoff’s letter bore date
March 8, and Monroe’s reply was sent March 11.
The letter of reply was a civil and somewhat flattering<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
compliment to Alexander;<a id="FNanchor_28" href="#Footnote_28" class="fnanchor">28</a> the mission itself was
a matter to be more deliberately arranged.</p>

<p>The next decision regarded the character of the
mission. The necessary powers might have been
sent, without further form, to Minister Adams at
St. Petersburg, but the President and his advisers
thought with reason that the addition of other negotiators
to the mission would give more weight and political
effect to the measure.<a id="FNanchor_29" href="#Footnote_29" class="fnanchor">29</a> They decided to send
two new envoys to join Adams; and on the same
reasoning to select prominent men. As a guaranty
of their wish for peace, they decided that one of
these men should be a Federalist, and they chose
James A. Bayard of Delaware for the post. For
the other, Monroe thought of naming some Western
man, to secure the confidence of the Western country,
and reconcile it to the result; but a different
turn was given to the measure by Gallatin, who
asked the appointment for himself. Gallatin’s exceptional
fitness for the task outweighed all objections.
The President consented to appoint him; and
Monroe, who had from the first attached himself to
Gallatin, acquiesced, although he saw the consequences
to the Cabinet and the Treasury.</p>

<p>A question less easy to decide was whether the new
mission should be despatched at once, or should wait
until England should formally accept the mediation.
There again political motives dictated immediate action.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
If England should accept, much time might be
saved if the mission were on the spot; if she did not
accept, the peace-party in America would be more
effectually silenced. In either case, Russia would be
deeply pledged to support her own undertaking.</p>

<p>The President did not intend to lose Gallatin in
the Treasury. Abundant precedents warranted the
double employment of government officers. In 1794
John Jay, then chief-justice, had been sent to negotiate
with England, and the Senate had approved the
appointment. In 1799 Oliver Ellsworth, also chief-justice,
was sent to negotiate with France, and the
Senate had again approved. These were Federalist
precedents, supposed to be binding, at least on the
Federalist party. If the chief-justice, the head of an
independent branch of government, could be sent
abroad as an Envoy Extraordinary in Executive employment,
no objection could exist to sending an
Executive officer on a temporary service of the same
kind, unless on the score of expediency. To prevent
difficulty on that account, the Secretary of the Navy
consented to act as head of the Treasury until Gallatin’s
return. Gallatin himself inclined to look on
his separation from the Treasury as final,<a id="FNanchor_30" href="#Footnote_30" class="fnanchor">30</a> but made
his arrangements in agreement with the President’s
views, which looked to his return in the autumn.</p>

<p>Before he could depart he was obliged to complete
the necessary financial arrangements for the coming
year, on which he was busily engaged at the moment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
when Daschkoff’s letter arrived. First in importance
was the loan of sixteen million dollars. March 12,
subscription books were opened in all the principal
towns, and the public was invited to take the whole
amount at seven per cent interest, to be reduced to
six per cent at the end of thirteen years. About four
million dollars were offered on these terms. Proposals
in writing were then invited by a Treasury circular,
dated March 18, and after an active negotiation
between Gallatin and three or four capitalists of New
York and Philadelphia,—John Jacob Astor, Stephen
Girard, David Parish,—the remainder of the loan
was provided. In all about eighteen millions were
offered. Fifteen and a half millions were taken, in
the form of six per cent stock, issued at eighty-eight
dollars for every hundred-dollar certificate, redeemable
after the year 1825. About half a million
was taken at par, with an annuity of 1½ per cent
for thirteen years, in addition to the six per cent
interest.</p>

<p>Calculated as a perpetual annuity, as English borrowers
would have viewed it, the rate of this loan was
less than seven per cent; but if the nominal capital
must or should be repaid after twelve years, the rate
was about 7.50 per cent. In the end, the government
paid 7.487 per cent, for the use of these sixteen millions
for thirteen years. The terms were not excessive
when it was considered that New England in
effect refused to subscribe. Perhaps the loan could
not have been taken at all, had not credit and currency<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
been already expanded to the danger-point, as
the allotment showed; for while New England, where
most of the specie was held, subscribed less than half
a million, and Boston took but seventy-five thousand,
Pennsylvania, where banking had become a frenzy,
took seven million dollars. New York and Baltimore
together contributed only half a million more than
was given by Philadelphia alone. Ten million dollars
were taken by Astor, Girard, and Parish,—three foreign-born
Americans, without whose aid the money
could not have been obtained on these terms, if at all.
Doubtless they were bold operators; but Americans
were supposed to be not wanting in the taste for
speculation, and the question could not but rise how
these men knew the secret of distributing the load
which no native American dared carry.</p>

<p>The bargain was completed April 7. At that moment
the Treasury was empty, and could not meet
the drafts of the other departments; but with sixteen
millions in hand, five millions of Treasury notes, and
an estimated revenue of something more than nine
millions, Gallatin collected about thirty million dollars,
and April 17 wrote to the Secretaries of War
and Navy,<a id="FNanchor_31" href="#Footnote_31" class="fnanchor">31</a> allotting to the one thirteen millions and
a quarter, to the other four and a half millions,
which could not be exceeded without the consent of
Congress. This done, and every question having
been settled that could be foreseen,—the tax-bills
ready to be laid before Congress, and even the draft<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
for a new bank-charter prepared,—Gallatin bade farewell
to the Treasury, and May 9 sailed from the
Delaware River, with Bayard, for the Baltic.</p>

<p>Twelve years had passed since Gallatin took charge
of the finances, and his retirement was an event
hardly less serious than a change of President; for
it implied that the political system he had done so
much to create and support stood so near the brink
of disaster as to call him from the chosen field of
his duties into a new career, where, if anywhere, he
could save it. As Monroe felt called to the army, so
Gallatin turned naturally to diplomacy. He knew
that after another year of war the finances must be
thrown into disorder like that of the Revolutionary
War, beyond the reach of financial skill; and he
believed that if any one could smooth the path of
negotiation, that person was likely to serve best the
needs of the Treasury. Yet he took grave responsibility,
of which he was fully aware, in quitting his
peculiar post at a moment so serious. Success alone
could save him from universal censure; and perhaps
nothing in his career better proved the high character
he bore, and the extraordinary abilities he possessed,
than the ease with which he supported responsibility
for this almost desperate venture.</p>

<p>The task he had set for himself was hopeless, not
so much because of the concessions he was to require,
as on account of the change in European affairs which
made England indifferent for the moment to any
injury the United States could inflict. Monroe’s instructions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
to the new commission, though long, consisted
largely in arguments against the legality of
impressment as a part of the <i lang="la">jus gentium</i>; although
the legality of European war-measures had long
ceased to be worth discussing. As the solution of
the dispute, Monroe could offer only the new Foreign
Seamen Act, which England had refused from
the first to consider, and which was certainly open
to objections,—on the American side because it offered
too much; on the British side because it offered
more than could in practice be performed. To make
the utmost possible concession, Monroe proposed that
no native-born British subject, thenceforward naturalized
in America, should be allowed to serve either
in the national or the private vessels of the United
States,—a provision which carried one step further
the offer to naturalize no British seamen except on
condition of leaving the sea, and which went to the
verge of conceding the right of impressment. Notwithstanding
these concessions, the instructions were
still positive on the main point. Without a clear and
distinct stipulation against impressments, no treaty
was to be signed; negotiations must cease, and the
negotiators must return home.<a id="FNanchor_32" href="#Footnote_32" class="fnanchor">32</a></p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the winter the Republican legislature of
New York chose Rufus King, the chief Federalist in
the country, to succeed John Smith as United States
senator. Some Republicans charged that this election
was the price paid by De Witt Clinton for
Federalist votes in the Presidential contest; but
Clinton’s friends declared it to be the price paid by
the Administration Republicans for Federalist aid in
granting a corrupt bank charter. That the choice
was due to a bargain of some kind no one denied,
and possibly both stories were true. Rufus King
himself stood above suspicion, and had been considered
an opponent of the Federalist alliance with
Clinton; but he was a powerful recruit to the opposition
in the Senate, which numbered thenceforward
nine votes, or precisely one fourth of the body. The
annoyance to the Administration was the greater because
King’s Republican colleague, Obadiah German,
belonged to the Clintonian opposition, and voted with
the Federalists. At the same time Charles Cutts of
New Hampshire was succeeded by Jeremiah Mason,
a very able and extreme Federalist. Three more
senators—Giles, Samuel Smith, and Michael Leib—could<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span>
be counted as personally hostile to the President.
Jesse Franklin of North Carolina was succeeded
by David Stone, an independent, opposed to
the war. Already the opposition threatened to outweigh
the votes on which the President could depend.
As though legislation had become a matter of inferior
importance, William H. Crawford of Georgia, the only
vigorous Republican leader in the Senate, resigned his
seat, and followed Gallatin to Europe. He was sent
to take the place of Joel Barlow at Paris, and hurried
to his post. In this condition of party weakness, the
election of Rufus King and Jeremiah Mason to the
Senate was a disaster to the Administration; and
all the more anxiously the President feared lest the
popular election in May should convert New York
altogether into a Federalist State, and give Massachusetts
the necessary strength to stop the war.</p>

<p>This election, on which the fate of the war was
believed to turn, took place as usual, May 1, and
began by a Federalist success in the city of New York,
followed by another in Kings, Queens, and Westchester
counties. These counties before the century
ended had a voting population of near half a million,
but in 1813 they cast in State elections about
eight thousand votes, and gave a majority of eight
hundred for the Federalist candidate Stephen Van
Rensselaer, the unfortunate general of the Niagara
campaign. Throughout the eastern and central counties
the election was disputed; three of the four districts
into which the State was divided left the result<span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span>
so close—within about three hundred votes—that
only the western counties of Cayuga, Seneca, and
Genesee turned the scale. Governor Tompkins was
re-elected by the moderate majority of three thousand
in a total vote of eighty-three thousand; but the Federalists
obtained a majority of ten in the Assembly,
and gained confidence with their strength. In this
election, for the first time, the issue was distinct between
those who supported and those who opposed
the war. The chief towns, New York, Hudson, and
Albany, were strong in opposition; the country districts
tended to support.</p>

<p>In Massachusetts the Federalist governor Caleb
Strong, who had made himself peculiarly obnoxious
by refusing to call out the State’s quota of militia,
received nearly fifty-seven thousand votes, while
Senator Varnum, the Republican candidate, received
forty-three thousand. Considering that the population
of Massachusetts was about one fourth smaller
than that of New York, the vote of one hundred
thousand persons in the smaller State, and only
eighty-three thousand in the larger, seemed a proof
of popular indifference; but in truth the vote of
New York was larger than usual, and only one thousand
less than at the next election of governor, in
1816. The difference was due to the unequal suffrage,
which in New York State elections was restricted
to one hundred pound free-holds, while in
Massachusetts all citizens worth sixty pounds were
entitled to vote.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span></p>

<p>At the same time John Randolph met with defeat,
for the only time in his life. John W. Eppes, one of
Jefferson’s sons-in-law, took residence within Randolph’s
district for the purpose of contesting it; and
after a struggle succeeded in winning the seat, on the
war-issue, by a vote of eleven hundred and twelve to
nine hundred and forty-three.<a id="FNanchor_33" href="#Footnote_33" class="fnanchor">33</a> This change of membership
tended, like the New York election, to show
that the people were yielding to the necessity of
supporting the war. Yet the process was alarmingly
slow. In the second year of hostilities, New Hampshire,
Massachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, and
New Jersey were Federal in all branches of their
State governments; New York, Delaware, and Maryland
were partly Republican and partly Federalist;
of the eighteen States only ten were wholly Republican,
and seven of these were Southern. In the
United States Senate the Administration could count
upon twenty-two votes, with reasonable certainty; the
other fourteen senators were more or less lukewarm
or hostile. In the House, one hundred and fourteen
members supported the Administration, and sixty-eight
opposed it. As far as concerned numbers,
the Administration was strong enough in Congress;
but the universal want of faith in its capacity to conduct
a war of such consequence gave the Federalists
an advantage beyond proportion to their numerical
strength. The task of opposition was easy, and its
force irresistible when the ablest and oldest Republican<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
in office—the Secretary of the Treasury—felt
himself helpless in face of the Government’s inaptitude
for war, and wrote to his closest intimates that
no one could “expect much improvement in the
manner of making it more efficient. I think that
there exists real incapacity in that respect,—an incapacity
which must necessarily exhaust our resources
within a very short time.”<a id="FNanchor_34" href="#Footnote_34" class="fnanchor">34</a></p>

<p>Fortunately for the Government the same slowness
of movement which counteracted its undertakings, affected
equally its internal enemies in their hostility.
The New England extremists wished and expected
to act energetically against the war. Chief-Justice
Parsons quieted Pickering in the autumn of 1812 by
assuring him that the Massachusetts House of Representatives
would act at its winter session;<a id="FNanchor_35" href="#Footnote_35" class="fnanchor">35</a> yet the
legislature met and adjourned without action. The
party waited for the spring election of 1813, which
was to give them control of New York. Their disappointment
at the re-election of Governor Tompkins
was extreme, and the temptation to wait until the
national government should become bankrupt and
disgraced became irresistible. Another campaign was
likely to answer their purpose. While England grew
stronger every day, America grew weaker; the
struggle became more and more unequal, the result
more and more certain; and the hope of peaceably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
restoring the Federalist party to power diminished
the temptation to adopt measures of force.</p>

<p>Thus when the Thirteenth Congress met for its
extra session, May 24, the Government felt stronger
than on March 5, when the old Congress expired.
The elections were safely passed; the peace negotiations
might be considered as begun; taxation was
no longer a matter of taste. The majority liked
taxation as little in 1813 as they had liked it in 1812
or in 1801; but they could no longer dispute or even
discuss it. Gallatin had gone, leaving the bills for
them to pass; and Congress, which at any other
time would have rebelled, had no choice but to pass
them.</p>

<p>Once more Henry Clay was chosen Speaker, and
setting Cheves aside he placed John W. Eppes at the
head of the Ways and Means Committee. The House
missed John Randolph, but gained John Forsyth of
Georgia, and Daniel Webster,—a new member from
New Hampshire, of the same age as Calhoun and
Lowndes, but five years younger than Clay. Otherwise
the members varied little from the usual type,
and showed more than their usual faculty for discussing
topics no longer worth discussion.</p>

<p>President Madison’s Message of May 25 challenged
no angry comment. Its allusion to the Russian
mediation and the terms of peace had an accent of
self-excuse, as though he were anxious to convince
England of her true interests; its allusion to France
contained the usual complaint of delays “so unreasonably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_54">54</span>
spun out;” and its reference to the war and
the finances was rather cheerful than cheering. Daring
as Madison’s policy had been, he commonly spoke
in tones hardly to be called bold; and this Message
had the disadvantage, which under the circumstances
could not be called a fault, of addressing itself rather
to Europe and to enemies, than to a spirited and
united nation. It had also the merit of directing
Congress strictly to necessary business; and Congress
acted on the direction.</p>

<p>Nothing less than necessity could at that moment
of early summer have induced the members of Congress
to remain in session at all. Stout as the majority
might be in support of the war, the stoutest
were depressed and despondent. They saw themselves
disappointed in every hope and calculation on
which they had counted a year before. Even their
unexpected naval glory was lost for the moment by
the victory of Broke’s frigate the “Shannon” over
the “Chesapeake,” June 1, as Congress began its
work. Disaster after disaster, disgrace upon disgrace,
had come and were every moment multiplying.
Suffocated with heat, members were forced to
sit day by day in the half-finished Capitol, with a
Southern village about them, their nearest neighbor
a British fleet. “Defeated and disgraced everywhere,”
said one of the stanchest war members describing
the scene, “Congress was to impose the
burden of taxes on a divided people, who had been
taught by leaders of the war party to look upon a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
tax-gatherer as a thief, if not to shoot him as a burglar.”<a id="FNanchor_36" href="#Footnote_36" class="fnanchor">36</a>
According to the same authority, “the country
was at the lowest point of depression, where fear
is too apt to introduce despair.” In this condition
of spirits, Gallatin’s tax-bills were reported to the
House June 10,—measures such as the Republican
party had, till very lately, not conceived as within
the range of its possible legislation. They included
a direct tax of three million dollars; taxes on salt,
licenses, spirits, carriages, auctions, sugar refineries;
a stamp tax, and a complete machinery for the assessment
and collection of these odious and oppressive
imposts.</p>

<p>At the same moment, Daniel Webster began his
career in Congress by moving Resolutions which
caused a long and unprofitable debate on the conduct
of France and the character of the French repealing
Decree of April 28, 1811,—a debate that could have
no other result or object than to mortify and annoy
the President, who had been, like so many other
rulers, the victim of Napoleon’s audacity. Pending
this debate, June 13, the President took to his bed
with a remittent fever, and for five weeks his recovery
was doubtful. Madison was still confined to his bed,
when, July 15, messengers from the lower Potomac
brought news that the British fleet, consisting of
eight or ten ships-of-the-line and frigates, was in the
river, sixty miles below, making its way up the difficult
channel to Washington. A reasonable and well-grounded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
fear took possession of the city. July 21,
Serurier wrote to his <span class="locked">Government:<a id="FNanchor_37" href="#Footnote_37" class="fnanchor">37</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Every one is making ready to move. I know that
they are secretly packing up at the Departments. I have
as yet sent nothing away, in order not to show distrust of
the Government’s power; but I have got ready my most
valuable papers, and from the moment the President shall
quit his residence, I shall follow where he goes, with my
principal portfolios in one of my carriages.”</p>
</div>

<p>The British ships were approaching the city; the
sound of their guns was believed to be heard; and
the Government had little means of stopping them.
Every man prepared for volunteer duty; other work
was suspended. About three thousand militia and volunteers,
among whom were all the Cabinet and many
members of Congress, were mustered, and marched to
Fort Washington, which was occupied by some six
hundred regular troops, with the Secretary of War at
their head; while the Secretary of the Navy took his
post on the 28-gun frigate “Adams” in the river
beneath, and the Secretary of State rode down the
river shore with a cavalry scouting party to reconnoitre
the British ships.<a id="FNanchor_38" href="#Footnote_38" class="fnanchor">38</a> July 15 and 16 the House
of Representatives ordered a Fast, and went into
secret session to consider modes of defence.</p>

<p>Unfortunately the motion for inquiry was made by
a Federalist. The majority, determined to make no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span>
admissions, referred the subject to the Military Committee,
which reported the next day through its chairman,
Troup of Georgia, that the preparation was “in
every respect adequate to the emergence.” When a
majority could benefit only its enemies by telling the
truth, history showed that honorable men often preferred
to tell what was untrue. In this case the
British ships made their soundings, and obtained
whatever knowledge they sought; then left the river
to visit other parts of the Bay, but never were so far
distant that they might not, with energy and a fair
wind, within four-and-twenty hours, have raided the
defenceless village. They had but to choose their
own time and path. Not a defensible fort or a picket-fence
stood within ten miles of Washington, nor could
a sufficient garrison be summoned in time for defence.
Armstrong, Jones, and Monroe doubtless assured Congress
that their means of defence were “in every
respect adequate,” but Congress took the responsibility
on its own shoulders when it accepted their
assurance.</p>

<p>Perhaps of all the incompetence shown in the war
this example most exasperated patriotic citizens, because
it was shared by every branch of the government.
For six months the Administration and its
friends had denounced Hull, Van Rensselaer, and
Smyth for betraying the government, while the Clintonians
and peace Democrats had denounced the
President for imbecility; but in regard to the city of
Washington the generals were not in question, for no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span>
generals were there, while the President was dangerously
ill in bed. The Legislature and Cabinet were
chiefly responsible for whatever should happen,—the
more because their warning was ample, even if under
such circumstances warning was needed. If Jefferson
assumed as a matter of course that William Hull
was to be shot and Stephen Van Rensselaer broken
for their mistakes, Republicans might properly ask
what punishment should be reserved for Armstrong,
Jones, and Monroe of the Cabinet, Troup of Georgia,
Sevier of Tennessee, Wright of Maryland, and other
members of the Military Committees of the House
and Senate for their neglect of the national capital.</p>

<p>The debate on Webster’s Resolutions, and the report
made in consequence by Monroe, July 12, tended
to throw additional discredit on the Government.
In no respect did Madison’s Administration make an
appearance less creditable than in its attitude toward
Napoleon’s Decrees, again and again solemnly asserted
by it to have been repealed, in the face of
proof that the assertion was unfounded. No Federalist
rhetoric was necessary to make this mortification
felt. Madison seldom expressed himself with
more bitterness of temper than in regard to the Emperor’s
conduct, and with Monroe the subject drew
forth recurrent outbursts of anger and disgust. His
report tacitly admitted everything that the Federalists
charged, except that the Administration had a
secret engagement with France: it had deceived itself,
but it had not wilfully deceived the public.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span></p>

<p>While the House was busied with these unpleasant
subjects, the Senate took up the President’s recent
nominations. May 29, four names were sent to it
for diplomatic appointments,—those of Albert Gallatin,
J.&nbsp;Q. Adams, and James A. Bayard, to negotiate
treaties of peace and commerce with Great Britain,
and a treaty of commerce with Russia; that of Jonathan
Russell to be Minister Plenipotentiary to Sweden.
Rufus King immediately began opposition by moving
three Resolutions of inquiry in regard to the nature
of the Russian appointments and the authority under
which the Treasury was to be administered in the
Secretary’s absence. The President replied, June 3,
that the duties of the Secretary of the Treasury were
discharged by the Secretary of the Navy under the
provisions of the Act of 1792. The Senate, by a
vote of twenty to fourteen, referred the matter to
a committee consisting of Anderson of Tennessee,
Rufus King, Brown of Louisiana, and Bledsoe of
Kentucky. Anderson, the chairman, wrote to the
President and went to see him on behalf of the committee,
but received only the answer that the President
declined to discuss the matter with them in
their official character. The Senate then adopted a
Resolution that the functions of Secretary of the
Treasury and Envoy Extraordinary were incompatible.
The Federalists obtained on this vote the support
of Giles, Leib, and Samuel Smith, German of
New York, and Gilman of New Hampshire, all of
whom were disaffected Republicans; but even with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
this aid they would have failed without the votes of
Anderson, Bledsoe, and the two Louisiana senators,
who joined the malcontents.</p>

<p>Madison was then slowly recovering strength, and
greatly harassed by anxieties. He would not sacrifice
Gallatin to the Senate; he hoped that firmness
would carry the point,<a id="FNanchor_39" href="#Footnote_39" class="fnanchor">39</a> and at worst he could
throw upon senators the charge of factious opposition.
This he succeeded in doing. July 16 the
Senate committee, naturally expecting Madison to
suggest some arrangement, once more sought and
obtained a conference,—“when the President was
pleased to observe,” said their report,<a id="FNanchor_40" href="#Footnote_40" class="fnanchor">40</a> “that he was
sorry that the Senate had not taken the same view
of the subject which he had done; and that he regretted
that the measure had been taken under circumstances
which deprived him of the aid or advice
of the Senate. After the committee had remained
a reasonable time for the President to make any
other observations if he thought proper to do so,
and observing no disposition manifested by him to
enter into further remarks, the committee retired
without making any observations on the matter of
the Resolutions, or in reply to those made by the
President.”</p>

<p>Finding itself thus defied, the Senate, without more
discussion, rejected Gallatin’s nomination by eighteen
votes to seventeen, Anderson and the two Louisiana<span class="pagenum" id="Page_61">61</span>
senators still adhering to the hostile interest.
Adams and Bayard were then confirmed with little
opposition.</p>

<p>After the passage of many years, the propriety of
the decision may still be left open to debate. As far
as the Federalists were concerned, their votes contradicted
their own precedents; and if they conceded,
as their precedents required, that the question was
not one of law but of expediency, they assumed responsibility
in acting as final judges. The incompatibility
asserted by them was a matter of dispute.
Two successive chief-justices had been sent as envoys
abroad. No one could doubt that the Secretary
of the Treasury, or any other member of the
Executive or Judicial departments, might be appointed
to negotiate a treaty in Washington. Temporary
absence from Washington had never implied incompatibility.
Everyone knew that the Secretary of War
meant in person to conduct the war on the frontier.
No one could question the President’s right to appoint
acting secretaries. If convenience alone was
the point at issue, surely the President knew best
the demands of his own Executive departments, and
might be trusted with the responsibility which belonged
to him. That he should fail to see, as soon
as the Senate could discover, an incompatibility that
would work only against himself, need not be taken
for granted by his own party, whatever might be the
case with the opposition.</p>

<p>On the other hand every one might admit that as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span>
the country grew, Secretaries of the Treasury were
likely to find work in their own Department that
would effectually limit their capacity for foreign
travel; and if the Senate thought that stage to be
already reached, senators were right in insisting
upon the appointment of a new secretary in Gallatin’s
place. Unfortunately for their argument, their
power did not extend so far. Gallatin remained Secretary
of the Treasury, and continued to negotiate as
such, without paying attention to the Senate or its
theories.</p>

<p>The Senate further weakened its position in acting
on the nomination of Jonathan Russell as Minister
to Sweden. The subject was referred, June 2, to a
committee consisting of Senator Goldsborough of
Maryland, together with Anderson and Rufus King.
Jonathan Russell had made himself obnoxious to the
peace party by eagerness shown, while he was in
charge at London, to bring on the war. The committee
not only entered on an investigation of his
doings at Paris, but also introduced a Resolution
declaring that any mission to Sweden at that time
was inexpedient, and by order of the Senate asked
a conference with the President. Monroe, angry at
this conduct, declared privately that a faction in the
Senate, counting on the death not only of President
Madison but of Vice-President Gerry, and the election
of Giles as President of the Senate, were scheming
to usurp the Executive power.<a id="FNanchor_41" href="#Footnote_41" class="fnanchor">41</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span></p>

<p>In order to counteract their manœuvre, and also to
relieve the President, who was then dangerously ill,
Monroe took the ground that the Executive would
not confer with a co-ordinate branch of government
except through an agent, because his dignity would
not allow him to meet a committee except by a committee
of his own. Monroe thus expressed this somewhat
unrepublican doctrine: “A committee of the
Senate ought to confer with a committee of the
President through a head of a Department, and not
with the Chief Magistrate; for in the latter case a
committee of that House is equal to the President.”<a id="FNanchor_42" href="#Footnote_42" class="fnanchor">42</a>
As a necessary conclusion, Monroe’s argument seemed
to the Senate not beyond dispute; but they answered
it, three days afterward, still less logically, by passing
Goldsborough’s Resolution that it was inexpedient
at that time to send a Minister Plenipotentiary
to Sweden.</p>

<p>Whatever might have been the case with Gallatin’s
rejection, no one could doubt that the vote on
Russell’s appointment was factious. When twenty-two
senators, including Jeremiah Mason, Christopher
Gore, Samuel Dana, Rufus King, and William B. Giles,
declared that a minister resident in Sweden was inexpedient
in the summer of 1813, they declared what
every other well-informed man knew to be an error.
If any American envoy was ever expedient, it was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span>
an envoy to Sweden in 1813; for in Sweden at that
moment all that was left of American commerce
centred after being driven from England, and the
political interests of Sweden were greatly involved
with those of the United States. The error was the
less to be denied, because, only six months afterward,
the Senate admitted itself in the wrong, and
approved the appointment of Russell.</p>

<p>These votes of the Senate made a deep impression.
In time of peace and safety the Senate might show
factiousness without necessarily exciting public anger,
although at no time was the experiment quite safe;
but at a moment like July, 1813, when public opinion
tended toward a serious temper, factiousness
was out of place, and was the more dangerous because
President Madison, though never showing great
power as a popular leader, had still a clear perception
of the moment when to strike an enemy. He
rarely failed to destroy when he struck. The time
had come when the Republican party, with one voice,
would be obliged to insist that party discipline must
be restored; and this result was precipitated by the
Senate’s conduct in regard to the diplomatic nominations.</p>

<p>An illustration of the dangers into which the spirit
of faction at that excited moment led the factious,
was furnished by the legislature of Massachusetts,
which met, May 26, and after listening to a long
speech from Governor Strong arraigning the national
government for its injustice to England and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span>
partiality to France, referred the subject to committees
which lost no time in reporting. One of these
reports, presented June 4 by Josiah Quincy of the
State Senate, closed with a Resolution that the Act
admitting Louisiana into the Union violated the Constitution,
and that the Massachusetts senators in Congress
should use their utmost endeavors to obtain its
repeal. Another report, by a joint committee, contained
a remonstrance addressed to Congress against
the war, couched in terms of strong sectional hostility
to the Southern States, and marked throughout
by a covert argument for disunion. A third report,
also by Josiah Quincy, on a naval victory lately
won by Captain James Lawrence of the “Hornet,”
contained a phrase even longer remembered than
Quincy’s assertion that the Government could not be
kicked into a war. The Government had in fact been
kicked into the war, but Quincy was not the better
pleased. He reported that in order not to give offence
to many of the good people of the Commonwealth
by appearing to encourage the continuance of
an unjust, unnecessary, and iniquitous war, the Massachusetts
senate while admiring Lawrence’s virtues
refrained from approving his <span class="locked">acts,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“And to the end that all misrepresentations on this
subject may be <span class="locked">obviated,—</span></p>

<p><i>Resolved</i>, as the sense of the Senate of Massachusetts,
that in a war like the present, waged without justifiable
cause, and prosecuted in a manner which indicates that
conquest and ambition are its real motives, it is not
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span>becoming a moral and religious people to express any
approbation of military or naval exploits which are not
immediately connected with the defence of our sea-coast
and soil.”</p>
</div>

<p>Such tactics, whether in or out of Congress, were
more dangerous to their authors than any blunders
of the Administration could ever be to the party in
power. If the nation should be successful in the
war, it might perhaps in good nature leave unpunished
the conduct of its malcontents; but if by
their means the nation should be conquered or
forced into a humiliating peace, the people would
never forget, and never forego revenge. Mere opposition
to foreign war rarely injured public men,
except while the war-fever lasted. Many distinguished
statesmen of Europe and America had been,
at one time or another, in opposition to some special
war,—as was the case with Talleyrand, Charles James
Fox, Lord Grey, Jefferson, and Madison; but opposition
became unpardonable when it took a form
which could have no apparent object except national
ruin. The Federalists who held the ideas expressed
by the legislature of Massachusetts could explain or
defend their future course only by the conviction that
the inevitable and long-expected “crisis” was at
hand, which must end either in disunion or in reconstruction
of the Union on new ground. As “a moral
and religious people,” they separated from the common
stock, and thenceforward, if the Union lasted,
could expect no pardon.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span></p>

<p>The extravagance of the Massachusetts Federalists
was counterbalanced by the same national disasters
which caused it. Nothing showed that the war was
popular in any of the sea-board States; but the
pressure of circumstances, little by little, obliged
lukewarm and even hostile communities to support
it. Virginia and the Southern States were drawn
into relations toward the government which they
had never intended to accept. Pennsylvania, Kentucky,
and Tennessee submitted to exactions that
would at any previous stage of their history have
produced a revolution. Perhaps the strongest proof
of change in popular prejudices was furnished by
the taxes. Tax-bills which were supposed to have
already overthrown one great political party,—bills
which inflicted the evils so hotly and persistently
denounced by Jefferson, Gallatin, and John Randolph
in opposition, and which had been long delayed by
fear of their popular effect,—were passed by Congress
quickly, by decided votes, and with less debate
than was given to the discussion whether the President
had or had not told all he knew about Bassano’s
Decree of April 28, 1811. From the time
they were approved by the President, in July and
August, 1813, to the time of their repeal, neither the
President nor his party was troubled by popular discontent
on account of the passage of these Acts. They
were accepted as a necessary part of the national
system, and of a war-policy.</p>

<p>The most curious symptom, and the one which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span>
most perplexed the Federalists, was that this popular
movement of concentration acted in direct resistance
to the movement of events. In every respect
as the Federalists looked back at the past twelve
years their prophecies had come true. The Republican
party, they argued, had proved itself incompetent,
and had admitted the failure of its principles;
it had been forced to abandon them in practice, to
replace the government where the Federalists had
put it, and to adopt all the Federalists’ methods;
and even then the party failed. Equally imbecile
in peace and war, the democratic movement had
ended in such disgrace and helplessness as few governments
had ever outlived, and such as no nation
with a near and powerful neighbor could have survived.
In 1813 the evidence of downfall had become
patent. The government was ruined in credit
and character; bankrupt, broken, and powerless, it
continued to exist merely because of habit, and must
succumb to the first shock. All this the Federalists
had long foreseen. Fisher Ames in the press, scores
of clergymen in the pulpit, numberless politicians in
Congress, had made no other use of their leisure
than to point out, step by step, every succeeding
stage in the coming decline. The catastrophe was no
longer far away, it was actually about them,—they
touched and felt it at every moment of their lives.
Society held itself together merely because it knew
not what else to do.</p>

<p>Under circumstances following each other in necessity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span>
so stringent, no Federalist could doubt that
society would pursue the predicted course; but it did
not. Illogical and perverse, society persisted in extending
itself in lines which ran into chaos. The
threatened “crisis” had arrived, wanting no characteristic
of those so long foretold; but society made
no effort to save itself. A vaster ruin and still
more terrible retribution lay beyond. The Federalists
were greatly and naturally perplexed at discovering
the silent under-current which tended to grow
in strength precisely as it encountered most resistance
from events. They tried to explain the phenomenon
in their own way,—the clergy according to
religious conceptions, the politicians according to their
ideas of popular character. The political theory was
the more plausible and less respectable. A.&nbsp;C. Hanson,
the extreme Maryland Federalist, mobbed and
nearly killed in Baltimore in June, 1812, only to be
elected to Congress in November, thought that the
national movement of 1813 was due to military glory.
Hanson wrote to Pickering on the subject, in the
<span class="locked">autumn:<a id="FNanchor_43" href="#Footnote_43" class="fnanchor">43</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The war is becoming more popular every day in this
State [Maryland]. Our successes, and the weak manner
in which it is conducted by the enemy make it so....
It would seem that after a while, unless the British
can gather the sense and courage to strike some severe
blows, the war by its own generative powers will create
the means for its support. The vanity of a people cannot<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
bear these brilliant naval victories, and there is no
passion to which the rulers of a people can address themselves
with greater effect. Even in my district the active
opposers of the war are falling off every day, and
unless we shortly meet with some reverses, the Administration
will shortly find more friends than enemies in this
State by a great deal.... The impression is becoming
universal that the enemy cannot harm us if he would.
A few hard blows struck in the right place would be of
great service to the country.”</p>
</div>

<p>A people that could feel its vanity flattered by such
glories as the war gave in 1813 must have felt the
want of flattery to an unusual degree. The idea was
extravagant. Not so much the glories as the disgraces
of the war roused public sympathy; not so
much the love of victory as the ignominy of defeat,
and the grinding necessity of supporting government
at any cost of private judgment. At such a moment
any success was keenly felt, and covered every
failure. The slow conviction that come what would
the nation must be preserved, brought one man after
another into support of the war, until the Federalists
found their feet in a quicksand. The “crisis” produced
the opposite effect to that which Burke’s philosophy
predicted.</p>

<p>Congress finished its work, and August 2 adjourned.
Immediately afterward the President went
to Montpelier to recover his strength in the air of
the Blue Ridge. The session had not been unsatisfactory,
for although the Senate refused to impose
an embargo, wanted by the President in order to cut<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span>
off illegitimate trade with England’s dependencies,
and although the same body put its negative on the
appointments of Gallatin and Jonathan Russell, yet
Congress passed the tax-bills, authorized another loan
of seven and a half millions, and made the business
of trading under a British license a penal offence.
The operations of war alone remained to burden the
President’s mind.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> fall of Detroit and Chicago in August, 1812,
threw the American frontier back to the line of the
Wabash and the Maumee, and threatened to throw
it still farther back to the Indian boundary itself.
The Miami or Maumee River was defended by Fort
Wayne; the Wabash had no other defence than the
little fort or blockhouse which Harrison built during
the Tippecanoe campaign, and named after himself.
Fort Harrison stood near the later city of Terre
Haute, close to the border of Illinois; Fort Wayne
stood within twenty miles of the Ohio border. The
width of Indiana lay between the two.</p>

<p>Had Brock been able, after the capture of Detroit,
to lead his little army into Ohio, he might have
cleared not only the Maumee River, but the whole
western end of Lake Erie from American possession.
Recalled in haste to defend Niagara, Brock left only
two or three companies of troops as garrison at
Detroit and Malden. The Indians could do little
without the aid of regular forces, but they tried to
carry both Fort Wayne and Fort Harrison by stratagem.
The attacks were made almost simultaneously
a few days after September 1, and not without skill.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span>
In the case of Fort Harrison the Indians were nearly
successful, not so much in fighting as in burning it.
With great difficulty its young captain, Zachary Taylor,
of the Seventh Infantry, succeeded in saving his
post. Fort Wayne was held by Captain James Rhea
of the First Infantry until reinforcements arrived,
September 12. Except the usual massacres of scattered
families, the Indians accomplished nothing.</p>

<p>Upon the State of Ohio, with its quarter of a million
inhabitants, and of Kentucky with four hundred
thousand, fell the immediate burden of defending the
border between the Ohio and the Lakes. Governor
William Henry Harrison of the Indiana Territory
leaving Vincennes June 19, the day after the declaration
of war, was at Cincinnati when threatening news
began to arrive from Detroit. Harrison had military
knowledge and instincts. He saw that after the capture
of Mackinaw Detroit must fall, and that Hull
could save himself only by evacuating it.<a id="FNanchor_44" href="#Footnote_44" class="fnanchor">44</a> Harrison’s
ambition, which had drawn him to Tippecanoe, drew
him also to lead the new crusade for the relief or
recovery of Detroit. He went to Kentucky at the
invitation of Governor Scott, and under the patronage
of Scott and Henry Clay he took the direction
of military affairs. August 24 news reached Kentucky
that Hull was shut in Detroit, and must surrender
unless immediately relieved.<a id="FNanchor_45" href="#Footnote_45" class="fnanchor">45</a> The Governor
of Kentucky at once summoned what was then called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
a <em>caucus</em>, composed of himself, his successor elect
Governor Shelby, Henry Clay, Justice Todd of the
United States Supreme Court, Major-General Hopkins
of the Kentucky militia, various Congressmen,
judges, and other citizens,<a id="FNanchor_46" href="#Footnote_46" class="fnanchor">46</a> whose whole authority
was needed to warrant giving to Harrison, who was
not a citizen of Kentucky, the commission of major-general
and the command of the expedition to Detroit.
By general acclamation, and on the warm
assurances of universal popular approval, the measure
was taken; and Harrison started at once for
Cincinnati and Detroit to organize the campaign.
The news of Hull’s surrender met him as he left
Frankfort.</p>

<p>By this combination of skill and accident, Harrison
reached the object of his ambition,—the conduct of
war on a scale equal to his faith in his own powers; but
the torrent of Western enthusiasm swept him forward
faster than his secret judgment approved. Appointed
by caucus the general of volunteers, he could keep
his position only by keeping his popularity. Without
deciding precisely where to march, or what military
object to pursue, he talked and acted on the idea that
he should recover Detroit by a <i lang="fr">coup-de-main</i>.<a id="FNanchor_47" href="#Footnote_47" class="fnanchor">47</a> He
knew that the idea was baseless as a practical plan,
and futile as a military measure; but nothing less
would satisfy the enthusiasm of his Kentucky volunteers,
and the national government almost compelled<span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span>
him to pretend what he did not at heart believe
possible.</p>

<p>The confusion thus created was troublesome. First,
Harrison insisted on commanding the troops marching
to relieve Fort Wayne, and obliged the good-natured
General Winchester, who outranked him, to
yield the point.<a id="FNanchor_48" href="#Footnote_48" class="fnanchor">48</a> Then after a forced march with
the Kentuckians down the St. Mary’s River, having
relieved Fort Wayne, Harrison was obliged, September
19, to surrender the command to Winchester,
who arrived with orders from the Secretary of War
to take general charge of the northwestern army.
Harrison then left Fort Wayne for Piqua. Meanwhile
the President and Eustis, learning what had
been done in Kentucky, September 17, after much
debate decided to give to Harrison the commission
of brigadier-general, with the command of the northwestern
army, to consist of ten thousand men, with
unlimited means and no orders except to retake Detroit.<a id="FNanchor_49" href="#Footnote_49" class="fnanchor">49</a>
Brigadier-General Winchester, who was already
at Fort Wayne, was given the option of serving
under Harrison, or of joining the army at Niagara.</p>

<p>These new orders reached Harrison September 25
at Piqua. Harrison then resumed command, and two
days afterward, September 27, wrote to the secretary,
announcing his plan for the autumn campaign.
Three columns of troops, from widely distant quarters,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span>
were to move to the Maumee Rapids,—the
right column, consisting of Virginia and Pennsylvania
troops, by way of the Sandusky River; the
centre column, of twelve hundred Ohio militia, by
Hull’s road; the left column, consisting of four
Kentucky regiments and the Seventeenth U.&nbsp;S. Infantry,
was to descend the Auglaize River to Fort
Defiance on the Maumee, and thence to fall down
that river to the point of junction with the two
other columns.</p>

<p>Compared with Hull’s resources, Harrison’s were
immense; and that he had no serious enemy to fear
was evident from his dividing the army into three
columns, which marched by lines far beyond supporting
distance of each other. At the same time he
ordered Major-General Hopkins of the Kentucky
militia to march with two thousand men up the
Wabash into the Indian country, and to destroy the
Indian settlements on the Wabash and Illinois rivers.
Had a British force been opposed to the Americans,
its general would have had little difficulty in destroying
some one of these four isolated columns, and
driving Harrison back to central Ohio; but only
bands of Indians, not exceeding five hundred at most,
were to be feared before the army should cross the
Maumee, and little anxiety existed on account of
enemies, unless for the safety of Fort Wayne.</p>

<p>Harrison’s anxieties bore a different character.
September 23 he wrote to the Secretary of War:
“If the fall should be very dry, I will take Detroit<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
before the winter sets in; but if we should have much
rain, it will be necessary to wait at the rapids until
the Miami of the Lakes is sufficiently frozen to bear
the army and its baggage.”<a id="FNanchor_50" href="#Footnote_50" class="fnanchor">50</a> The promise was rash.
However dry the season might be, the task of marching
an army with siege-artillery past Malden to Detroit,
and of keeping it supplied from a base two hundred
miles distant, with the British commanding the
Lake, was one which Harrison had too much sense
to attempt. Nothing but disaster could have resulted
from it, even if Detroit had been taken. In the
actual condition of that territory, no army could be
maintained beyond the Maumee River without controlling
the Lake. Perhaps Harrison was fortunate
that constant rains throughout the month of October
brought the army to a halt long before it reached the
Maumee. Only the left division of five Kentucky
regiments succeeded in getting to the river, and
camped in the neighborhood of old Fort Defiance,
waiting for the other columns to reach the rapids.
There the Kentuckians remained, under the command
of General Winchester, without food, clothing, or
sufficient shelter, in a state of increasing discontent
and threatening mutiny, till the year closed.</p>

<p>Within a month after assuming command Harrison
found himself helpless either to advance or to retreat,
or to remain in any fixed position. The supplies required
for ten thousand troops could not be sent
forward by any means then known. October 22 the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
left column, consisting of the Kentucky regiments
and some regulars, was at Defiance on the Maumee;
the central column of a thousand Ohio troops under
General Tupper was on Hull’s road, a hundred miles
from the Maumee, unable to march beyond Urbana,
where its supplies were collecting; the right column
of Pennsylvanians and Virginians was still farther
from the front, slowly approaching the Sandusky
River from the southeast, but far out of reach. General
Hopkins’s expedition up the Wabash ended in
failure, his troops becoming a mere mob, and at last
disbanding, leaving their general to follow them home.
Harrison himself was riding indefatigably through the
mud, from one end to the other of his vast concave
line,—now at Defiance, making speeches to pacify
Winchester’s Kentuckians; then at Piqua and Urbana
with the Ohioans; soon a hundred miles away
at the river Huron, east of Sandusky; next at Wooster,
Delaware, or Franklinton, afterward Columbus,
in the centre of Ohio, looking for his right wing;
but always searching for a passable ridge of dry
land, on which his supplies could go forward to the
Maumee Rapids. The result of his search was given
in a letter of October 22, from Franklinton, to the
Secretary of <span class="locked">War:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not able to fix any period for the advance of
the troops to Detroit. It is pretty evident that it cannot
be done upon proper principles until the frost shall become
so severe as to enable us to use the rivers and the
margin of the Lake for transportation of the baggage and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
artillery upon the ice. To get them forward through a
swampy wilderness of near two hundred miles, in wagons
or on packhorses which are to carry their own provisions,
is absolutely impossible.”</p>
</div>

<p>The obstacle which brought Harrison’s autumn
campaign to this sudden close was the vast swamp
that extended from the Sandusky River on his right
to the Auglaize River on his left, and for the moment
barred the passage of his necessary supplies as
effectually as though it had been the Andes. Hull
had crossed it, cutting a road as he went, and no one
had then appreciated his effort; but he had marched
with a small force in May and June. Harrison tried
to transport supplies, heavy guns, military stores, and
all the material for an army of ten thousand men on
a long campaign, as the autumn rains set in. On the
extreme right, with great effort and expense, a considerable
quantity of rations was accumulated on the
Sandusky River, to be sent to the Maumee Rapids
whenever the frosts should harden the swamps. On
the extreme left, desperate efforts were made to carry
supplies to Winchester’s army at Defiance by way of
the Auglaize and St. Mary’s rivers. Hull’s road was
impassable, and for that reason the column of Ohio
troops and their supplies were stopped in the neighborhood
of Urbana.</p>

<p>Throughout the months of October and November
Harrison’s army stood still, scattered over the State
of Ohio, while wagons and packhorses wallowed in
mud toward the Maumee Rapids. None arrived.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_80">80</span>
Sometimes the wagons were abandoned in the mud;
sometimes the packhorses broke down; sometimes
the rivers were too low for boats; then they froze and
stopped water-transport. Universal confusion, want
of oversight and organization, added to physical difficulties,
gave play to laziness, incapacity, and dishonesty.
No bills of lading were used; no accounts were
kept with the wagoners; and the teams were valued
so high, on coming into service, that the owners were
willing to destroy them for the price to be received.<a id="FNanchor_51" href="#Footnote_51" class="fnanchor">51</a>
The waste of government funds was appalling, for
nothing short of a million rations at the Maumee
Rapids could serve Harrison’s objects, and after two
months of effort not a ration had been carried within
fifty miles of the spot. In Winchester’s camp at
Defiance the men were always on half rations, except
when they had none at all. During the greater part
of December they had no flour, but lived on poor
beef and hickory roots. Typhus swept them away by
scores; their numbers were reduced to about one
thousand. The exact force which Harrison had in
the field was matter of conjecture, for he sent no
return of any description to the adjutant-general’s
office.<a id="FNanchor_52" href="#Footnote_52" class="fnanchor">52</a> The Government gave him <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i>,
and he used it.<a id="FNanchor_53" href="#Footnote_53" class="fnanchor">53</a> Chaos and misconduct reigned in
every department, while he, floundering through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span>
mud along his line of two hundred miles front, sought
in vain for a road.</p>

<p>For the train of errors and disasters in the northwest
Secretary Eustis was chiefly responsible, and his
resignation, Dec. 3, 1812, left the campaign in this
hopeless condition. From Dec. 3, 1812, until Jan. 13,
1813, Monroe acted as Secretary of War; and to him
Harrison next wrote from Delaware, December 12,
a letter which not only disheartened the Government,
but was calculated to create a prejudice against the
writer in the mind of any Secretary of War who was
not invincibly prejudiced in his favor.<a id="FNanchor_54" href="#Footnote_54" class="fnanchor">54</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If there were not some important political reason,”
said Harrison, “urging the recovery of the Michigan
Territory and the capture of Malden as soon as those
objects can possibly be effected, and that to accomplish
them a few weeks sooner expense was to be disregarded,
I should not hesitate to say that if a small proportion of
the sums which will be expended in the quartermaster’s
department in the active prosecution of the campaign
during the winter was devoted to obtaining the command
of Lake Erie, the wishes of the Government, in their utmost
extent, could be accomplished without difficulty in
the months of April and May. Malden, Detroit, and
Mackinaw would fall in rapid succession. On the contrary,
all that I can certainly promise to accomplish during
the winter, unless the strait should afford us a passage
on the ice, is to recover Detroit. I must further observe
that no military man would think of retaining Detroit,
Malden being in possession of the enemy, unless his army<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
was at least twice as strong as the disposable force of the
enemy. An army advancing to Detroit along a line of
operation passing so near the principal force of the enemy
as to allow them access to it whenever they think proper,
must be covered by another army more considerable than
the disposable force of the enemy. I mention this circumstance
to show that the attack ought not to be directed
against Detroit, but against Malden; and that it depends
upon the ice affording a safe passage across the strait,
whether I shall be able to proceed in this way or not.
Detroit is not tenable. Were I to take it without having
it in my power to occupy the opposite shore, I should be
under the necessity of hiding the army in the adjacent
swamp to preserve it from the effects of the shot and
shells which the enemy would throw with impunity from
the opposite shore. This result is so obvious to every
man who has the least military information, that it appears
to me as extraordinary as any other part of General
Hull’s conduct that he should choose to defend Detroit
rather than attack Malden.”</p>
</div>

<p>Hull could have asked no better apology for his
surrender. Harrison did not know that the insubordination
and refusal of the Ohio colonels to evacuate
Detroit had forced Hull to remain there; but
that Detroit was not tenable came at last to the
surface as a self-evident truth of the campaign,—which
Hull had always seen, and which Harrison
himself announced almost as clearly in August as in
December, but which he ignored in the interval.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If it should be asked,” he continued, “why these
statements were not made sooner,—I answer that although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span>
I was always sensible that there were great
difficulties to be encountered in the accomplishment of
the wishes of the President in relation to the recovery of
Detroit and the conquest of the adjacent part of Upper
Canada in the manner proposed, I did not make sufficient
allowance for the imbecility and inexperience of the
public agents and the villany of the contractors. I am
still, however, very far from believing that the original
plan is impracticable. I believe on the contrary that it
can be effected.”</p>
</div>

<p>The excuse did not satisfy the Cabinet, who thought
they saw that Harrison wished to throw upon Government
the responsibility for a military failure fatal to
himself. Perhaps a simpler motive guided Harrison,
who from the first never had known precisely what
to do, or had seen any clear path to success. He
wrote, January 4, from <span class="locked">Franklinton,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I was directed to take the command in the
latter end of September, I thought it possible by great
exertions to effect the objects of the campaign before the
setting in of winter.... The experience of a few days
was sufficient to convince me that the supplies of provisions
could not be procured for our autumnal advance;
and even if this difficulty was removed, another of equal
magnitude existed in the want of artillery. There remained
then no alternative but to prepare for a winter
campaign.”</p>
</div>

<p>According to this account he had seen early in
October that advance was impossible, yet he wasted
millions of money and many of his best troops in
attempting it. Winter had come, and he was pledged<span class="pagenum" id="Page_84">84</span>
to a winter campaign as impracticable as the autumn
campaign had proved to be. Without the
control of the Lake, any army beyond the Maumee
must starve or surrender. The government had already
paid a vast price in money and men in order
to obtain this knowledge; yet Harrison proposed
a winter campaign, with full persuasion of its uselessness.</p>

<p>December 20 he sent orders<a id="FNanchor_55" href="#Footnote_55" class="fnanchor">55</a> to Winchester to
descend the Maumee River from Defiance to the
rapids, there to prepare sleds for an expedition
against Malden, to be made by a choice detachment
when the whole army should concentrate at the rapids.
Early in January, the ground being at last
frozen, provisions in large quantities were hurried to
the Maumee River. Artillery was sent forward. The
Pennsylvania and Virginia brigades moved to the
Sandusky River, making an effective force of fifteen
hundred men at that point. The whole effective force
on the frontier amounted to six thousand three
hundred infantry.<a id="FNanchor_56" href="#Footnote_56" class="fnanchor">56</a> Harrison intended to move his
headquarters forward from the Sandusky, and to
reach the Maumee Rapids January 20, to which
point he supposed General Winchester already in
motion from Defiance.<a id="FNanchor_57" href="#Footnote_57" class="fnanchor">57</a></p>

<p>This was the situation January 12; and although<span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span>
Harrison hinted in his reports of January 4 and 8
that his winter campaign would probably fail,<a id="FNanchor_58" href="#Footnote_58" class="fnanchor">58</a> he
showed the intention of advancing at least as far
as the strait opposite Malden, about thirty-five miles
beyond the Maumee. This he might venture without
much danger; and if he reached that point, supposing
the straits to be frozen, the enemy to show little sign
of resistance, and the weather to favor, he might
attack Malden. Hull had been expected to take
Malden with twelve or fourteen hundred men, with
an open river behind him, a British fleet on his flank,
fifty miles of road to cover, and supplies for only a
few days at Detroit; but Harrison with six thousand
men, the river frozen and the British fleet frozen in
it, a secure base, with a million rations close in his
rear, and no Isaac Brock in his front, still spoke
with extreme doubt of his prospects, and said that
“most of the well-informed men who knew the character
of the country”<a id="FNanchor_59" href="#Footnote_59" class="fnanchor">59</a> expected a suspension of
operations for the winter.</p>

<p>Aware that from a military point of view no land-campaign
could, except by accident, effect any result
proportionate to its cost, Harrison had placed himself
at the head of a popular movement so strong that
he would have met the fate of Hull and Alexander
Smyth, had he not made at least a demonstration<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span>
against an enemy whose face he had not yet seen.
Forced by his own pledges and the public discontent
to enter on an unmilitary campaign, he was anxious
to risk as little as possible where he could hardly
expect to gain anything; and he would probably
have contented himself with his first scheme of a
<i lang="fr">coup-de-main</i> against Malden or Detroit, without attempting
to hold either place, had not his subordinate,
General Winchester, rescued him from an
awkward position by a blunder that relieved Harrison
of further responsibility.</p>

<p>Brigadier-General Winchester was a planter of
Tennessee, sixty-one years old, and formerly an officer
in the Revolutionary War. Though outranking
Harrison, he had allowed himself to be set aside by
what he thought intrigue,<a id="FNanchor_60" href="#Footnote_60" class="fnanchor">60</a> and consented to conduct
the left wing of the force under Harrison’s command.
Winchester was not a favorite with his Kentucky
militia-men, who had no choice in electing him to
their command. Their term of service was to expire
in February; they had been imprisoned since
September in a wilderness at Defiance,—hungry,
cold, sick, and mutinous, able to find no enemy willing
to fight them, and disgusted with idleness. No
sooner was the ground frozen and the general movement
of concentration possible, than Winchester’s
command by common consent, under Harrison’s orders,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
broke up their camp near Defiance and marched
to the rapids, where Hull’s road crossed the Maumee.
There they arrived January 10, as Harrison expected.
They fortified themselves on the north bank, and
waited for the arrival of Harrison, who intended to
join them January 20.</p>

<p>Winchester’s force included three regiments of
Kentucky militia, numbering nine hundred effectives,<a id="FNanchor_61" href="#Footnote_61" class="fnanchor">61</a>
and the Seventeenth United States Infantry,
numbering three hundred men, also Kentuckians.
Altogether he had under his command at the rapids
about thirteen hundred men,<a id="FNanchor_62" href="#Footnote_62" class="fnanchor">62</a>—a force barely sufficient
to hold the exposed position it had taken on
the north bank of the river. The three Kentucky
militia regiments were soon to go home. The other
columns were not yet within supporting distance. If
Colonel Proctor, who commanded at Malden, were
capable of imitating Brock’s enterprise, he would
hardly throw away an opportunity, which might
never recur, to strike a blow at the Kentuckians,
and by defeating them to drive Harrison’s army behind
the Sandusky River. Every military motive
warned Winchester not to divide, detach, or expose
his troops without caution. He was himself
a detachment, and he had no support nearer than
the Sandusky.</p>

<p>While the troops were busily engaged in building a
store-house and throwing up log-works in an injudicious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span>
and untenable position,<a id="FNanchor_63" href="#Footnote_63" class="fnanchor">63</a> two Frenchmen came
into camp, begging protection for the inhabitants of
Frenchtown on the river Raisin, thirty miles in front,
and within the British lines. Thirty-three families,
or about one hundred and fifty persons, were resident
at Frenchtown, and the place was held by a few Canadian
militia, supposed to consist of two companies,
with about as many Indians,—in all, some three
hundred men.<a id="FNanchor_64" href="#Footnote_64" class="fnanchor">64</a> This force might easily be destroyed,
and the loss to the British would be serious. Winchester’s
troops became eager to dash at them. A
council of war decided, January 16, without a voice
in remonstrance, that the movement should be made.
The most ardent supporter of the adventure was Col.
John Allen of the Kentucky Rifle regiment; but no
one offered opposition, and Winchester agreed to the
council’s opinion.<a id="FNanchor_65" href="#Footnote_65" class="fnanchor">65</a></p>

<p>The next morning, Jan. 17, 1813, Col. William
Lewis, of the Fifth Kentucky militia, started for the
river Raisin, with four hundred and fifty men.<a id="FNanchor_66" href="#Footnote_66" class="fnanchor">66</a> A
few hours afterward he was followed by Colonel
Allen with one hundred and ten men. No reports
told what regiments were taken, or where they were
at any moment stationed; but Lewis and Allen probably
led twelve companies, drawn from four Kentucky
regiments,—the Seventeenth United States<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span>
Infantry, recruited in Kentucky, commanded by Col.
Samuel Wells; the Kentucky Rifles, Col. John Allen;
the First Kentucky Infantry; and Colonel Lewis’s
regiment, the Fifth Kentucky Infantry,—in all, six
hundred and sixty men, representing the flower of
Kentucky.</p>

<p>They marched on the ice, along the shore of
Maumee Bay and Lake Erie, until nightfall, when
they camped, and at two o’clock the next afternoon,
January 18, reached without meeting resistance the
houses on the south bank of the river Raisin. The
north bank was occupied, according to British authority,<a id="FNanchor_67" href="#Footnote_67" class="fnanchor">67</a>
by fifty Canadian militia and two hundred
Indians. The British force opened fire with a three-pound
howitzer. The action began at three o’clock
and lasted till dark, when the enemy after an obstinate
resistance was driven about two miles into the
woods with inconsiderable loss.<a id="FNanchor_68" href="#Footnote_68" class="fnanchor">68</a> The action was
sharp, and cost the Americans not less than twelve
killed and fifty-five wounded, reducing their effective
number to six hundred.</p>

<p>Colonel Lewis had orders to take possession of
Frenchtown, and hold it. He reported his success
to General Winchester at the rapids, and remained
at Frenchtown waiting further orders. Winchester
became then aware that the situation was hazardous.
Six hundred men were with him in a half-fortified
camp on the north bank of the Maumee; six hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
more were thirty miles in advance, at the Raisin
River; while fully two thousand—or, according to
Harrison’s estimate, four thousand<a id="FNanchor_69" href="#Footnote_69" class="fnanchor">69</a>—enemies held
two fortresses only eighteen miles beyond the Raisin.
The Kentuckians at the Maumee, equally aware of
their comrades’ peril, insisted on going to their aid.
Winchester promptly started on the evening of January
19, and arrived at Frenchtown the next morning.
Colonel Wells’s Seventeenth United States
Infantry, two hundred and fifty men, followed, arriving
at Frenchtown in the evening.<a id="FNanchor_70" href="#Footnote_70" class="fnanchor">70</a></p>

<p>Winchester, before leaving the Maumee Rapids,
sent a despatch to Harrison with a report of the
battle of the 18th, which met Harrison on the road
hurrying to the Maumee Rapids. The next morning,
January 20, Harrison arrived at the camp on
the Maumee, and found there about three hundred
Kentucky troops,<a id="FNanchor_71" href="#Footnote_71" class="fnanchor">71</a> the remainder being all with Winchester
at the river Raisin. Probably Harrison, whose
own caution was great, felt the peril of Winchester’s
situation,<a id="FNanchor_72" href="#Footnote_72" class="fnanchor">72</a> but he sent his inspector-general, Captain
Hart, forward with orders to Winchester “to hold the
ground we had got at any rate,”<a id="FNanchor_73" href="#Footnote_73" class="fnanchor">73</a> while he wrote to
the Secretary of <span class="locked">War:—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_91">91</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Upon my way to this place [Maumee Rapids] last evening,
I received the letter from the General [Winchester]
of which the enclosed is a copy, informing me of the complete
success of the enterprise in the defeat of the enemy
and taking the stores they had collected. The detachment
under Colonel Lewis remain at the river Raisin,
and General Winchester very properly marched yesterday
with two hundred and fifty men to reinforce him and take
the command.... It is absolutely necessary to maintain
the position at the river Raisin, and I am assembling
the troops as fast as possible for the purpose.”<a id="FNanchor_74" href="#Footnote_74" class="fnanchor">74</a></p>
</div>

<p>Harrison added that his only fear was lest Winchester
should be overpowered. He waited at the
Maumee Rapids two days, until at noon, January 22,
a messenger arrived with disastrous tidings from the
front.</p>

<p>Winchester afterward told the story of his own
proceedings with so much candor that his narrative
became a necessary part of any explanation of his
<span class="locked">disaster:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Suspecting that Proctor would make an attempt to
avenge this stroke, and knowing that our wounded men
could not be removed, I hastened to reinforce Colonel
Lewis with Wells’s regiment, two hundred and fifty men;
and set out myself to join him, and arrived on the morning
of the 20th. The town, lying on the north side of
the river, was picketed on three sides, the longest facing
the north, and making the front. Within these pickets
Colonel Lewis’s corps was found. Not thinking the position<span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span>
eligible, nor the pickets a sufficient defence against
artillery, I would have retreated but for the wounded, of
whom there were fifty-five; but having no sufficient means
for transporting these, and being equally destitute of
those necessary for fortifying strongly, I issued an order
for putting the place in the best condition for defence
that might be practicable, intending to construct some
new works as soon as the means for getting out timber
might be had. On the evening of the 20th Wells arrived,
and was directed to encamp on the right, in an
open field, immediately without the picketing. On the
21st a patrol as far as Brownstown [opposite Malden]
was sent out, and returned without seeing anything of an
enemy. On the same day a man from Malden came in
who reported that the enemy were preparing to attack
us; but knowing nothing of the kind or extent of the
preparation made or making, what he brought was
thought to be only conjecture and such as led to a belief
that it would be some days before Proctor would be
ready to do anything.... Neither night-patrol nor
night-pickets were ordered by me, from a belief that both
were matters of routine and in constant use.... Not
to discommode the wounded men, ... I took quarters
for myself and suite in a house on the southern bank,
directly fronting the troops and only separated from
them by the river, then firmly frozen, and but between
eighty and a hundred yards wide.”</p>
</div>

<p>The only educated officer under Harrison’s command
was Major E.&nbsp;D. Wood of the Engineers, one
of the early graduates of West Point, and an officer
of high promise. He was not with Winchester’s
division, but with the right wing on the Sandusky,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span>
and arrived at the Maumee Rapids some ten days
afterward, where he built Fort Meigs, in February.
During the campaign he kept a diary, and his criticisms
of Winchester, Lewis, Allen, and their command
were quoted with approval by the Kentucky
historian,<a id="FNanchor_75" href="#Footnote_75" class="fnanchor">75</a> as well as by Harrison’s <span class="locked">biographer:<a id="FNanchor_76" href="#Footnote_76" class="fnanchor">76</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The troops were permitted to select, each for himself,
such quarters on the west side of the river as might
please him best, whilst the general ... took his quarters
on the east side,—not the least regard being paid
to defence, order, regularity, or system, in the posting
of the different corps.... With only one third or one
fourth of the force destined for that service; destitute
of artillery, of engineers, of men who had ever seen
or heard the least of an enemy; and with but a very
inadequate supply of ammunition,—how he ever could
have entertained the most distant hope of success, or
what right he had to presume to claim it, is to me one
of the strangest things in the world.... Winchester
was destitute of every means of supporting his corps
long at the river Raisin; was in the very jaws of the
enemy, and beyond the reach of succor. He who fights
with such flimsy pretensions to victory will always be
beaten, and eternally ought to be.”</p>
</div>

<p>Defeat under such conditions was disgraceful
enough; but defeat by Colonel Proctor was one of
the worst misfortunes that happened to an American
general. The Prince Regent took occasion, at the
close of the war, to express his official opinion of
this officer, then Major-General Proctor, in language<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
of unusual severity.<a id="FNanchor_77" href="#Footnote_77" class="fnanchor">77</a> Yet Proctor’s first movements
at the Raisin River showed no apparent sign of his
being “so extremely wanting in professional knowledge,
and deficient in those active, energetic qualities
which must be required of every officer,” as his later
career, in the Prince Regent’s opinion, proved him
to be. He had opposed Brock’s bold movement on
Detroit; but he did not hesitate to make a somewhat
similar movement himself. January 21 he marched
with artillery across the river on the ice, to Brownstown
opposite Malden, in full view of any American
patrol in the neighborhood. His force consisted of
six hundred whites, all told,<a id="FNanchor_78" href="#Footnote_78" class="fnanchor">78</a> besides either four
hundred and fifty, six hundred or eight hundred
Indians, under the chief Round Head, Tecumthe being
absent collecting reinforcements on the Wabash.<a id="FNanchor_79" href="#Footnote_79" class="fnanchor">79</a>
This large body of more than a thousand men,
without an attempt at concealment, crossed to
Brownstown and marched twelve miles, January 21,
camping at night within five miles of Frenchtown.<a id="FNanchor_80" href="#Footnote_80" class="fnanchor">80</a>
If the British historian James was correct, they
numbered eleven hundred and eighty men, of whom
five hundred and thirty were white, and the rest
Indians;<a id="FNanchor_81" href="#Footnote_81" class="fnanchor">81</a> but the official return reported the whites,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
including every person present, at five hundred and
ninety-seven men. Two hours before dawn, January
22, they again advanced, and before daybreak
approached within musket-shot of the picket-fence,
and half-formed their line, before an alarm was
given.</p>

<p>Had Proctor dashed at once on the defenceless
Seventeenth regiment and the fence that covered the
militia, he would probably have captured the whole
without loss; but he preferred to depend on his
three-pound guns, which gave the Kentuckians opportunity
to use their rifles. In such fighting the
Americans had much the advantage, especially as
British regulars were opposite them. Within an
hour the Forty-first regiment lost fifteen killed and
ninety-eight wounded, and of the entire body of six
hundred British troops not less than twenty-four
were killed and one hundred and sixty-one wounded.<a id="FNanchor_82" href="#Footnote_82" class="fnanchor">82</a>
Their three-pound guns were abandoned, so murderous
were the Kentucky rifles.<a id="FNanchor_83" href="#Footnote_83" class="fnanchor">83</a> Had all the American
troops been under cover, the battle would have
been theirs; but Wells’s Seventeenth regiment was
a hundred yards away, on open ground outside the
picket-fence on the right, where it was flanked by
the Canadian militia and Indians and driven back toward
the river, until Allen’s Rifle regiment went out
to help it. Gradually forced toward the rear, across
the river, this part of the line was at last struck<span class="pagenum" id="Page_96">96</span>
with a panic and fled, carrying with it Winchester
himself, Colonel Allen, and Colonel Lewis; while six
hundred Indians were in hot pursuit, or already in
advance of them.</p>

<p>In the deep snow escape was impossible. Nearly
a hundred Kentuckians fell almost side by side, and
were scalped. Among these was Colonel Allen.
General Winchester and Colonel Lewis were so fortunate
as to fall into the hands of the chief Round
Head, who first stripped them and then took them
to Proctor, who had for the time withdrawn his
forces and ceased firing. By Proctor’s advice, General
Winchester sent an order to the men within
the picket-fence to surrender.</p>

<p>By eight o’clock all resistance had ceased except
from three hundred and eighty-four Kentuckians
who remained within the picket-fence, under the
command of Major Madison of the Rifle regiment.
Surrounded by a thousand enemies, they had no
chance of escape. Their ammunition was nearly
exhausted; retreat was impossible; they could choose
only between surrender and massacre, and they surrendered.<a id="FNanchor_84" href="#Footnote_84" class="fnanchor">84</a>
The British officers looked at them with
curiosity, as they came within the British line.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Their appearance,” said Major Richardson,<a id="FNanchor_85" href="#Footnote_85" class="fnanchor">85</a> “was
miserable to the last degree. They had the air of men
to whom cleanliness was a virtue unknown, and their
squalid bodies were covered by habiliments that had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span>
evidently undergone every change of season, and were
arrived at the last stage of repair.... It was the depth
of winter; but scarcely an individual was in possession
of a great coat or cloak, and few of them wore garments
of wool of any description. They still retained their
summer dress, consisting of cotton stuff of various colors
shaped into frocks, and descending to the knee. Their
trowsers were of the same material. They were covered
with slouched hats, worn bare by constant use, beneath
which their long hair fell matted and uncombed over
their cheeks; and these, together with the dirty blankets
wrapped round their loins to protect them against the
inclemency of the season, and fastened by broad leathern
belts, into which were thrust axes and knives of an enormous
length, gave them an air of wildness and savageness
which in Italy would have caused them to pass for
brigands of the Apennines. The only distinction between
the garb of the officer and that of the soldier was that
the one, in addition to his sword, carried a short rifle
instead of a long one, while a dagger, often curiously
worked and of some value, supplied the place of the
knife.”</p>
</div>

<p>This description gave a lifelike idea of what
Harrison justly thought the best material in the
world for soldiery, had it been properly handled.
Men who for four months had suffered every hardship,
and were still unclothed, unfed, uncared for,
and sacrificed to military incompetence, but hardened
to cold, fatigue, and danger, had no reason to be
ashamed of their misfortunes or of their squalor.
Fortunately about five hundred were saved as prisoners,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>
and thirty or forty escaped to the rapids;
the rest, four hundred in number, were killed in
battle, or massacred afterward.</p>

<p>Had Proctor acted with energy, he might have
advanced to the rapids, and there have captured
Harrison with his remaining force of nine hundred
men, his artillery train and stores. Even with the
utmost celerity Harrison could hardly have escaped,
if an active pursuit had been made by Indians through
the swamp which he had with extreme difficulty
crossed two days before,<a id="FNanchor_86" href="#Footnote_86" class="fnanchor">86</a> and in the heavy rain which
followed the battle;<a id="FNanchor_87" href="#Footnote_87" class="fnanchor">87</a> but Proctor had no wish for
fighting. So far from thinking of attack, he thought
only of escaping it, and hurried back to Malden at
noon the same day, leaving the wounded prisoners
behind without a guard. Nothing excused such conduct,
for Proctor knew the fate to which he was
exposing his prisoners. That night the Indians,
drunk with whiskey and mad with their grievances
and losses, returned to Frenchtown and massacred
the wounded. About thirty perished, some apparently
burned. Fortunately for the United States the
glamour of Proctor’s victory hid his true character,
and he was made a major-general,—the most favorable
event of the war for the American armies he
was to meet, and one which cost Great Britain even
more in pride than in power.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">If</span> Proctor was afraid of Harrison, with more
military reason Harrison was afraid of Proctor; and
while the British colonel, deserting his wounded
prisoners, hurried from the field of battle, and felt
himself in danger until the next day he was again
entrenched at Malden, at the same moment Harrison,
burning the post at the Maumee Rapids and destroying
such stores as were collected there, hastened back
to the Portage or Carrying River some fifteen miles
in the rear. Within thirty-six hours after the battle,
the two enemies were sixty miles apart. At the Portage
River Harrison remained a week, until he had
collected a force of two thousand men. With these
he returned to the rapids February 1, and began to
construct a regularly fortified camp on the south
bank of the river. Fort Meigs, as it was called, did
credit to the skill of Major Wood, the engineer officer
who constructed it; but such a fortress seemed
rather intended for defence than for the conquest of
Canada.</p>

<p>In fact, Harrison had succeeded only in making
the most considerable failure that had thus far
marked the progress of the war; but while the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span>
public was still assuming treason and cowardice in
William Hull, who had been sent with fifteen hundred
men to hold Detroit and conquer Canada, and
had been left unsupported to face destruction,—the
same public admitted the excuses of Harrison, who
with ten thousand men, unlimited means, and active
support at Niagara, after four months of effort, failed
even to pass the Maumee River except with a detachment
so badly managed that only thirty-three
men in a thousand escaped. This was the crowning
misfortune which wrung from Gallatin the complaint
that a “real incapacity” for war existed in the
government itself, and must inevitably exhaust its
resources without good result; but although it drove
Gallatin to Europe, it left Harrison on the Maumee.
Harrison would not take on himself the disgrace of
admitting his inability to recapture Detroit, and the
President would not, without his express admission,
order him to desist. As Armstrong afterward
explained:<a id="FNanchor_88" href="#Footnote_88" class="fnanchor">88</a> “The Cabinet, not inexpert at
deciphering military diplomacy, and peculiarly shy of
incurring any responsibility it could avoid, determined,
with perhaps less of patriotism than of prudence,
to leave the question of continuing the winter
campaign exclusively with the General.” The General,
not inclined to sink into obscurity or to admit
failure, set himself to a third campaign as hopeless as
either of its predecessors. Ordering all the troops in
his rear to join him, making a body of four thousand<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span>
men, he fixed February 11 as the day for his advance
on Malden, not expecting to reduce that place,
but merely to raid it.<a id="FNanchor_89" href="#Footnote_89" class="fnanchor">89</a> When the day arrived, the
roads had again become impassable, the ice was no
longer safe; and Harrison, “with much reluctance
and mortification,”<a id="FNanchor_90" href="#Footnote_90" class="fnanchor">90</a> was reduced to write from the
Maumee Rapids to the Secretary of War that the
campaign must cease.</p>

<p>Thus the Western movement, likened by Henry
Clay to a tenth-century crusade, ended in failure.
The Government would have been in a better position
had it never sent a man to the Maumee, but merely
built a few sloops at Cleveland. The entire result
of six months’ immense effort was confined to raids
into the Indian country; and even these were costly
beyond proportion to their results. When the militia
of Kentucky and Ohio, which had been mustered
in August for six months’ service, returned to their
homes in February, 1813, not only had they failed
to reoccupy a foot of the ground abandoned by Hull,
but they left Harrison almost alone at Fort Meigs,
trembling lest the enemy should descend on his rear
and destroy his supplies, or force him back to protect
them.<a id="FNanchor_91" href="#Footnote_91" class="fnanchor">91</a> He had accumulated artillery, ammunition,
and stores at the Maumee Rapids, in a fortress
which itself required a garrison of two thousand men
and from which he could neither fall back, as he
thought the wiser course,<a id="FNanchor_92" href="#Footnote_92" class="fnanchor">92</a> nor remain with safety<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
exposed to an active enemy. He called for more
militia from Kentucky and Ohio, but the people no
longer felt enthusiasm for war.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am sorry to mention,” reported Harrison, March
17,<a id="FNanchor_93" href="#Footnote_93" class="fnanchor">93</a> “the dismay and disinclination to the service which
appear to prevail in the Western country; numbers
must give that confidence which ought to be produced by
conscious valor and intrepidity, which never existed in
any army in a superior degree than amongst the greater
part of the militia who were with me through the winter.
The new drafts from this State [Ohio] are entirely of
another character, and are not to be depended on.”</p>
</div>

<p>In short, Harrison, who had in 1812 commanded
ten thousand militia, seemed to think double the
number necessary for 1813, besides regular troops
and a fleet.</p>

<p>President Madison and two successive Secretaries
of War had allowed themselves, for fear of displeasing
Kentucky, to give Harrison <i lang="fr">carte blanche</i>,<a id="FNanchor_94" href="#Footnote_94" class="fnanchor">94</a> which
Harrison had used without other limit than that of
the entire resources of the West. The time at last
came when such management must be stopped, and
Secretary Armstrong, naturally impatient under the
load of Eustis’s and Monroe’s failures, quickly decided
to stop it. Harrison’s letter of February 11,
announcing his failure, reached the Department
March 1. March 5 the secretary wrote to Harrison
ordering him to maintain a threatening attitude,
but altering the mode of warfare. Henceforward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_103">103</span>
the army was to be made subordinate,—the navy
was to take the lead; and until the middle of May,
when the fleet on Lake Erie should be constructed,
Harrison was to maintain a strict defensive, and to
protect the line of the Maumee with six regular
regiments, only three of which had been yet partly
raised.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, Harrison had but a few hundred regulars
and some Pennsylvania and Virginia militia,—perhaps
five hundred men in all,—to hold Fort Meigs,
and mere squads of militia to guard eight other posts
which had cost the government some millions of
dollars. These five hundred troops, whose service
was mostly near its end, he left at Fort Meigs, and in
the middle of March he set out for Chillicothe and
Cincinnati. Greatly annoyed at the summary manner
in which Armstrong had put an end to his campaigning,
he protested only against the inadequacy of his
force for the defence required of it, and insisted on a
temporary reinforcement of militia to garrison the
fortress that had cost him so much effort to construct
at the Maumee Rapids.</p>

<p>Then the value of General Proctor to his enemy
became immense. Between January 22, when he
attacked Winchester, and the end of April, when he
moved on Fort Meigs, Proctor molested in no way
the weak and isolated American garrisons. With
hundreds of scouts and backwoodsmen at his command,
he had not the energy or the knowledge to
profit by his opponents’ exposed and defenceless condition.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span>
He allowed Major Wood to make Fort Meigs
capable of standing a siege; he let Harrison, unmolested,
pass a month away from his command; he
looked on while the Virginia militia marched home,
leaving only a handful of sickly men, under a major
of artillery, to defend the unfinished fort; he made
no attempt to waylay Harrison, who returned with
reinforcements by way of the Auglaize River; and
not until Harrison had enjoyed all the time necessary
to prepare for attack, did Proctor disturb him.</p>

<p>Harrison, expecting an assault, hurried back from
Cincinnati to Fort Meigs with some three hundred
men, leaving a brigade of Kentucky militia to follow
him. April 12 he reached the fort, but not till
April 28 did Proctor appear at the mouth of the
Maumee, with about five hundred regulars and nearly
as many militia,—nine hundred and eighty-three
whites, all told, and twelve hundred Indians under
Tecumthe and other chiefs.<a id="FNanchor_95" href="#Footnote_95" class="fnanchor">95</a> Besides this large
force, he brought two twenty-four pound guns with
other artillery from Detroit, and two gunboats
supported the land-battery. While the guns were
placed in position on the north bank of the river,
the Indians crossed and surrounded the fort on
the south. May 1 the batteries opened, and during
four days kept up a heavy fire. Proctor, like
Harrison, moved in the wilderness as though he were
conducting a campaign on the Rhine; he liked regular<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span>
modes of warfare, and with a force almost wholly
irregular, after allowing Fort Meigs to be built, he
besieged it as though he could take it by battering its
earthen ramparts. Untaught by his losses at the
river Raisin, he gave once more advantage to the
Kentucky rifle; and with every opportunity of destroying
the reinforcement which he knew to be near,
he allowed himself to be surprised by it.</p>

<p>The Kentucky brigade of twelve hundred men,
under Brigadier-General Green Clay, had descended
the Auglaize River in boats, and arrived at Defiance
May 3, where they learned that Fort Meigs was
invested. So neglectful of his advantages was Proctor
that he not only failed to prevent General Clay
from advancing, but failed to prevent communication
between the besieged fort and the relief-column, so
that Harrison was able to arrange a general attack
on the investing lines, and came near driving the
British force back to Malden with the loss of all its
artillery and baggage. At about nine o’clock on the
morning of May 5, Clay’s brigade descended the
rapids, and eight hundred and sixty-six men under
Colonel William Dudley,<a id="FNanchor_96" href="#Footnote_96" class="fnanchor">96</a> landing on the north side
of the river, surprised and took possession of the
British batteries, which were entirely unsupported.
Had Clay’s whole force been on the ground, and had
it been vigorously pushed forward, the small British
division which held the north bank must have abandoned
all its positions; but Dudley’s men were under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
no discipline, and though ready to advance were
in no hurry to retreat, even when ordered. Three
companies of the British Forty-first, and some of
the Canadian militia soon gathered together; and
although these could hardly have been half the number
of Dudley’s force,<a id="FNanchor_97" href="#Footnote_97" class="fnanchor">97</a> yet with Tecumthe and a
body of Indians they attacked the batteries, drove
the Kentuckians out, dispersed them, and either captured
or massacred the whole body, under the eyes
of Harrison and Fort Meigs.</p>

<p>This affair, though little less fatal to the Americans
than that of the river Raisin, was much less dearly
bought by the British. Five hundred prisoners fell
into Proctor’s hands; two or three hundred more of
the Kentucky brigade, including “the weak and obstinate
but brave”<a id="FNanchor_98" href="#Footnote_98" class="fnanchor">98</a> Dudley himself, must have been
either killed in battle or massacred after surrender;<a id="FNanchor_99" href="#Footnote_99" class="fnanchor">99</a>
only one hundred and seventy escaped; the
boats with the baggage were captured; while the
whole British loss on the north side of the river
hardly exceeded fifty killed and wounded. A bitter
feeling against Proctor was caused by the massacre of
some forty American prisoners while under a British
guard, and also, as was alleged, under the eyes of
General Proctor, who did not interpose, although a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span>
soldier of the Forty-first was murdered in trying to
protect them. Probably all the prisoners would have
been massacred had Tecumthe not ridden up at full
speed, tomahawk in hand, and threatened to kill the
first Indian who defied his authority.<a id="FNanchor_100" href="#Footnote_100" class="fnanchor">100</a></p>

<p>On the south side Harrison had better fortune, and
Colonel John Miller of the Nineteenth U.&nbsp;S. Infantry
by a sortie gallantly captured a battery, with some
forty prisoners; but neither on the north nor on the
south did the fighting of May 5 decide any immediate
military result. Besides losing on the north bank half
the reinforcement brought by General Green Clay,
Harrison had lost in the siege and in the sorties on
the south bank nearly three hundred men in killed
and wounded.<a id="FNanchor_101" href="#Footnote_101" class="fnanchor">101</a> If the numbers loosely reported in the
American accounts were correct, the siege cost Harrison
one thousand men, or fully half his entire force,
including his reinforcements. After the fighting of
May 5, he withdrew once more into the fort; the
British batteries reopened fire, and the siege went on.
No further attempt was made to trouble the enemy in
open field. Harrison felt himself too weak for further
ventures; yet never had his chance of a great
success been so fair.</p>

<p>Proctor’s siege of Fort Meigs was already a failure.
Not only had the fort proved stronger than he expected,
but the weather was bad; his troops were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span>
without shelter; dysentery and loss in battle rapidly
weakened them; half his militia went home, and,
what was fatal to further action, his Indians could
not be held together. Within three days after the
battle of May 5, the twelve hundred Indians collected
by Tecumthe’s influence and exertions in the northwest
territory dispersed, leaving only Tecumthe himself
and a score of other warriors in the British camp.<a id="FNanchor_102" href="#Footnote_102" class="fnanchor">102</a>
Proctor had no choice but to retire as rapidly as
possible, and May 9 embarked his artillery and left
his encampment without interference from Harrison,
who looked on as a spectator while the movement
was effected.</p>

<p>From that time until the middle of July Proctor
remained quiet. Harrison moved his headquarters to
Upper Sandusky and to Cleveland, and began to prepare
for advance under cover of a naval force; but he
was not allowed to rest, even though Proctor might
have preferred repose. Proctor’s position was difficult.
Told by Sir George Prevost<a id="FNanchor_103" href="#Footnote_103" class="fnanchor">103</a> that he must capture
what supplies he needed from the Americans,
and must seek them at Erie and Cleveland, since
Lower Canada could spare neither food nor transport,
he was compelled to look for support to the American
magazines. He was issuing ten thousand rations a
day to the Indian families at Malden, and his resources<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
were near an end.<a id="FNanchor_104" href="#Footnote_104" class="fnanchor">104</a> Leaving Malden with
either three hundred and ninety-one regulars, or about
five hundred regulars and militia, and by one British
account nearly a thousand Indians, by another between
three and four thousand,<a id="FNanchor_105" href="#Footnote_105" class="fnanchor">105</a> Proctor returned
by water to the Maumee Rapids July 20, and tried
to draw the garrison of Fort Meigs into an ambush.
The attempt failed. General Green Clay, who was
in command, had learned caution, and imposed it on
his troops. Proctor then found that his Indians were
leaving him and returning to Detroit and Amherstburg.
To occupy them, Proctor took again to his
boats and coasted the Lake shore as far as the
Sandusky River, while the Indians who chose to accompany
him made their way by land. August 1
the expedition effected a landing at the mouth of
the Sandusky, and scattered panic into the heart
of Ohio.</p>

<p>In truth, nothing could be more alarming than this
movement, which threatened Harrison in all directions,—from
Fort Meigs, on the Maumee, to Erie, or
Presqu’isle, where Perry’s fleet was building. On
Sandusky River Harrison had collected his chief
magazines. All the supplies for his army were lying
at Upper Sandusky, some thirty miles above the
British landing-place, and he had only eight hundred
raw recruits to defend their unfortified position.<a id="FNanchor_106" href="#Footnote_106" class="fnanchor">106</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_110">110</span>
Nothing but an untenable stockade, called Fort
Stephenson, on the Sandusky River, where the town
of Fremont afterward grew, offered an obstacle to
the enemy in ascending; and Tecumthe with two
thousand Indians was said to be moving from Fort
Meigs by the direct road straight for the magazines,
thus flanking Fort Stephenson and every intermediate
position on the Sandusky.</p>

<p>In just panic for the safety of his magazines, the
only result of a year’s campaigning, Harrison’s first
thought was to evacuate Fort Stephenson in order to
protect Upper Sandusky. The flank-attack from two
thousand Indians, who never showed themselves, impelled
him to retire before Proctor, and to leave the
river open. July 29, after a council of war, he sent
down a hasty order to young Major Croghan who
commanded Fort Stephenson, directing him immediately
to burn the fort and retreat up the river or
along the Lake shore, as he best could, with the
utmost haste.<a id="FNanchor_107" href="#Footnote_107" class="fnanchor">107</a> Croghan, a Kentuckian, and an officer
of the Seventeenth U.&nbsp;S. regiment, refused to obey.
“We have determined to maintain this place, and by
Heaven, we will,” he wrote back.<a id="FNanchor_108" href="#Footnote_108" class="fnanchor">108</a> Harrison sent
Colonel Wells, of the same regiment, to relieve him;
but Croghan went to headquarters, and by somewhat
lame excuses carried his point, and resumed his command
the next day. Harrison gave him only conditional
orders to abandon the fort,—orders which
Croghan clearly could not regard, and which Harrison<span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span>
seemed to feel no confidence in his wishing to follow.<a id="FNanchor_109" href="#Footnote_109" class="fnanchor">109</a>
In the face of British troops with cannon he was to
retreat; but “you must be aware that the attempt to
retreat in the face of an Indian force would be vain.”
Proctor’s main force was believed to be Indian.</p>

<p>Neither evacuating nor defending Fort Stephenson,
Harrison remained at Seneca, ten miles behind it,
watching for Tecumthe and the flank attack, and
arranging a plan of battle for his eight hundred men
by which he could repel the Indians with dragoons
in the open prairie.<a id="FNanchor_110" href="#Footnote_110" class="fnanchor">110</a> Croghan remained at Fort
Stephenson with one hundred and sixty men, making
every preparation to meet an attack. August 1 the
woods were already filled with Indians, and retreat
was impossible, when the British boats appeared on
the river, and Proctor sent to demand surrender of
the fort. Immediately on Croghan’s refusal, the
British howitzers opened fire and continued until it
became clear that they were too light to destroy the
stockade.</p>

<p>If experience had been of service to Proctor, he
should have learned to avoid direct attack on Americans
in fortified places; but his position was difficult,
and he was as much afraid of Harrison as Harrison
was afraid of him. Fearing to leave Croghan’s little
fort in the rear, and to seek Harrison himself, ten
miles above, on the road to Upper Sandusky; fearing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span>
delay, which would discontent his Indian allies; fearing
to go on to Cleveland or Erie without crippling
Harrison; still more afraid to retire to Malden without
striking a blow,—Proctor again sacrificed the
Forty-first regiment which had suffered at the river
Raisin and had been surprised at Fort Meigs. On
the afternoon of August 2 the Forty-first regiment
and the militia, in three columns of about one hundred
and twenty men each,<a id="FNanchor_111" href="#Footnote_111" class="fnanchor">111</a> with the utmost gallantry
marched to the pickets of Fort Stephenson, and were
shot down. After two hours’ effort, and losing all its
officers, the assaulting column retired, leaving twenty-six
dead, forty-one wounded, and about thirty missing,
or more than one fifth of their force. The same night
the troops re-embarked and returned to Malden.</p>

<p>Proctor’s report<a id="FNanchor_112" href="#Footnote_112" class="fnanchor">112</a> of this affair was filled with complaints
of the Indians, who could not be left idle and
who would not fight. At Sandusky, he said, “we
could not muster more hundreds of Indians than I
might reasonably have expected thousands.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I could not, therefore, with my very small force remain
more than two days, from the probability of being
cut off, and of being deserted by the few Indians who had
not already done so.... On the morning of the 2d inst.
the gentlemen of the Indian department who have the
direction of it, declared formally their decided opinion
that unless the fort was stormed we should never be able
to bring an Indian warrior into the field with us, and that
they proposed and were ready to storm one face of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
fort if we would attempt another. I have also to observe
that in this instance my judgment had not that
weight with the troops I hope I might reasonably have
expected.... The troops, after the artillery had been
used for some hours, attacked two faces, and impossibilities
being attempted, failed. The fort, from which
the severest fire I ever saw was maintained during the
attack, was well defended. The troops displayed the
greatest bravery, the much greater part of whom reached
the fort and made every effort to enter; but the Indians
who had proposed the assault, and, had it not been assented
to, would have ever stigmatized the British character,
scarcely came into fire before they ran out of its
reach. A more than adequate sacrifice having been made
to Indian opinion, I drew off the brave assailants.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sir George Prevost seemed to doubt whether Proctor’s
excuse for the defeat lessened or increased the
blame attached to it.<a id="FNanchor_113" href="#Footnote_113" class="fnanchor">113</a> The defeat at Sandusky ruined
Proctor in the esteem of his men. On the American
side, Harrison’s conduct roused a storm of indignation.
Through the whole day, August 2, he remained at
Seneca with eight hundred men, listening to the cannonade
at Fort Stephenson till late at night, when he
received an express from Croghan to say that the
enemy were embarking. The story ran, that as the
distant sound of Croghan’s guns reached the camp at
Seneca, Harrison exclaimed: “The blood be on his
own head; I wash my hands of it.<a id="FNanchor_114" href="#Footnote_114" class="fnanchor">114</a>” Whatever else<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>
might be true, his conduct betrayed an extravagant
estimate of his enemy’s strength. The only British
eye-witness who left an account of the expedition
reckoned Proctor’s force, on its departure from Malden,
at about four hundred troops, and “nearly a
thousand Indians.”<a id="FNanchor_115" href="#Footnote_115" class="fnanchor">115</a> The Indians dispersed until
those with Proctor at Fort Stephenson probably numbered
two or three hundred,<a id="FNanchor_116" href="#Footnote_116" class="fnanchor">116</a> the rest having returned
to Detroit and Malden. Harrison reported the British
force as five thousand strong, on the authority
of General Green Clay.<a id="FNanchor_117" href="#Footnote_117" class="fnanchor">117</a></p>

<p>Whether the British force was large or small,
Harrison’s arrangements to meet it did not please
Secretary Armstrong. “It is worthy of notice,” he
wrote long afterward,<a id="FNanchor_118" href="#Footnote_118" class="fnanchor">118</a> “that of these two commanders,
always the terror of each other, one [Proctor]
was now actually flying from his supposed pursuer;
while the other [Harrison] waited only the arrival
of Croghan at Seneca to begin a camp-conflagration
and flight to Upper Sandusky.”</p>

<p>The well-won honors of the campaign fell to Major
George Croghan, with whose name the whole country
resounded. Whatever were the faults of the two
generals, Major Croghan showed courage and intelligence,
not only before and during the attack, but
afterward in supporting Harrison against the outcry
which for a time threatened to destroy the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span>
General’s authority. Immediately after the siege
of Fort Stephenson every energy of the northwest
turned toward a new offensive movement by water
against Malden, and in the task of organizing the
force required for that purpose, complaints of past
failures were stifled. Secretary Armstrong did not
forget them, but the moment was not suited for
making a change in so important a command. Harrison
organized, under Armstrong’s orders, a force of
seven thousand men to cross the Lake in boats, under
cover of a fleet.</p>

<p>The fleet, not the army, was to bear the brunt
of reconquering the northwest; and in nothing did
Armstrong show his ability so clearly as in the
promptness with which, immediately after taking
office, he stopped Harrison’s campaign on the
Maumee, while Perry was set to work at Erie.
Feb. 5, 1813, Armstrong entered on his duties.
March 5 his arrangements for the new movements
were already made. Harrison did not approve them,<a id="FNanchor_119" href="#Footnote_119" class="fnanchor">119</a>
but he obeyed. The Navy Department had already
begun operations on Lake Erie, immediately after
Hull’s surrender; but though something was accomplished
in the winter, great difficulties had
still to be overcome when February 17 Commander
Perry, an energetic young officer on gunboat service
at Newport, received orders from Secretary Jones
to report to Commodore Chauncey on Lake Ontario.
Chauncey ordered him to Presqu’isle, afterward<span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span>
called Erie, to take charge of the vessels under construction
on Lake Erie. March 27 he reached the
spot, a small village in a remote wilderness, where
timber and water alone existed for the supply of
the fleets.</p>

<p>When Perry reached Presqu’isle the contractors
and carpenters had on the stocks two brigs, a
schooner, and three gunboats. These were to be
launched in May, and to be ready for service in June.
Besides these vessels building at Erie, a number of
other craft, including the prize brig “Caledonia,”
were at the Black Rock navy-yard in the Niagara
River, unable to move on account of the British fort
opposite Buffalo and the British fleet on the Lake.
Perry’s task was to unite the two squadrons, to man
them, and to fight the British fleet, without allowing
his enemy to interfere at any stage of these difficult
operations.</p>

<p>The British squadron under Commander Finnis, an
experienced officer, had entire control of the Lake
and its shores. No regular garrison protected the
harbor of Presqu’isle; not two hundred men could
be armed to defend it, nor was any military support
to be had nearer than Buffalo, eighty miles away.
Proctor or Prevost were likely to risk everything in
trying to destroy the shipyard at Erie; for upon that
point, far more than on Detroit, Fort Meigs, Sandusky,
or Buffalo, their existence depended. If Perry
were allowed to control the Lake, the British must
not only evacuate Detroit, but also Malden, must<span class="pagenum" id="Page_117">117</span>
abandon Tecumthe and the military advantages of
three or four thousand Indian auxiliaries, and must
fall back on a difficult defensive at the Niagara River.
That they would make every effort to thwart Perry
seemed certain.</p>

<p>Superstition survived in nothing more obstinately
than in faith in luck; neither sailors nor soldiers ever
doubted the value of this inscrutable quality in the
conduct of war. The “Chesapeake” was an unlucky
ship to the luckiest commanders, even to the British
captain who captured it. The bad luck of the
“Chesapeake” was hardly steadier than the good
luck of Oliver Perry. Whatever he touched seemed
to take the direction he wanted. He began with the
advantage of having Proctor for his chief enemy;
but Harrison, also a lucky man, had the same advantage
and yet suffered constant disasters. Commander
Finnis was a good seaman, yet Finnis failed
repeatedly, and always by a narrow chance, to injure
Perry. Dearborn’s incompetence in 1813 was
not less than it had been in 1812; but the single
success which in two campaigns Dearborn gained
on the Niagara obliged the British, May 27, to
evacuate Fort Erie opposite Buffalo, and to release
Perry’s vessels at Black Rock. June 6, at leisure,
Perry superintended the removal of the five small
craft from the navy-yard at Black Rock; several
hundred soldiers, seamen, and oxen warped them
up stream into the Lake. Loaded with stores, the
little squadron sailed from Buffalo June 13; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
wind was ahead; they were five days making eighty
miles; but June 19 they arrived at Presqu’isle, and
as the last vessel crossed the bar, Finnis and his
squadron came in sight. Finnis alone could explain
how he, a first-rate seaman, with a strong force and
a fair wind, in such narrow seas, could have helped
finding Perry’s squadron when he knew where it
must be.</p>

<p>From June 19 to August 1 Perry’s combined fleet
lay within the bar at Presqu’isle, while Proctor, with
a sufficient fleet and a military force superior to anything
on the Lake, was planning expeditions from
Malden against every place except the one to which
military necessity and the orders of his Government
bade him go. August 4, Perry took out the armaments
of his two brigs and floated both over the
bar into deep water. Had the British fleet been at
hand, such a movement would have been impossible
or fatal; but the British fleet appeared just as Perry’s
vessels got into deep water, and when for the first
time an attack could not be made with a fair hope
of success.</p>

<p>These extraordinary advantages were not gained
without labor, energy, courage, and wearing anxieties
and disappointments. Of these Perry had his full
share, but no more; and his opponents were no
better off than himself. By great exertions alone
could the British maintain themselves on Lake
Ontario, and to this necessity they were forced to
sacrifice Lake Erie. Sir George Prevost could spare<span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span>
only a new commander with a few officers and some
forty men from the lower Lake to meet the large
American reinforcements on the upper. When the
commander, R.&nbsp;H. Barclay, arrived at Malden in
June, he found as many difficulties there as Perry
found at Presqu’isle. Barclay was a captain in the
British Royal Navy, thirty-two years old; he had lost
an arm in the service, but he was fairly matched as
Perry’s antagonist, and showed the qualities of an
excellent officer.</p>

<p>Perry’s squadron, once on the Lake, altogether overawed
the British fleet, and Barclay’s only hope lay
in completing a vessel called the “Detroit,” then on
the stocks at Amherstburg. Rough and unfinished,
she was launched, and while Perry blockaded the
harbor, Barclay, early in September, got masts and
rigging into her, and armed her with guns of every
calibre, taken from the ramparts.<a id="FNanchor_120" href="#Footnote_120" class="fnanchor">120</a> Even the two
American twenty-four pound guns, used by Proctor
against Fort Meigs, were put on board the “Detroit.”
Thus equipped, she had still to be manned; but no
seamen were near the Lake. Barclay was forced to
make up a crew of soldiers from the hardworked
Forty-first regiment and Canadians unused to service.
September 6 the “Detroit” was ready to sail,
and Barclay had then no choice but to fight at any
risk. “So perfectly destitute of provisions was the
port that there was not a day’s flour in store, and
the crews of the squadron under my command were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span>
on half allowance of many things; and when that was
done, there was no more.”<a id="FNanchor_121" href="#Footnote_121" class="fnanchor">121</a></p>

<p>Early on the morning of September 9 Barclay’s
fleet weighed and sailed for the enemy, who was
then at anchor off the island of Put-in-Bay near
the mouth of Sandusky River. The British squadron
consisted of six vessels,—the “Detroit,” a ship
of four hundred and ninety tons, carrying nineteen
guns, commanded by Barclay himself; the “Queen
Charlotte” of seventeen guns, commanded by Finnis;
the “Lady Prevost” of thirteen guns; the “Hunter”
of ten; the “Little Belt” carrying three, and the
“Chippeway” carrying one gun,—in all, sixty-three
guns, and probably about four hundred and fifty men.
The American squadron consisted of nine vessels,—the
“Lawrence,” Perry’s own brig, nearly as large
as the “Detroit,” and carrying twenty guns; the
“Niagara,” commander Jesse D. Elliott, of the same
tonnage, with the same armament; the “Caledonia,”
a three-gun brig; the schooners “Ariel,” “Scorpion,”
“Somers,” “Porcupine,” and “Tigress,” carrying ten
guns; and the sloop “Trippe,” with one gun,—in all,
fifty-four guns, with a nominal crew of five hundred
and thirty-two men, and an effective crew probably
not greatly differing from the British. In other respects
Perry’s superiority was decided, as it was
meant to be. The Americans had thirty-nine thirty-two
pound carronades; the British had not a gun of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span>
that weight, and only fifteen twenty-four pound carronades.
The lightest guns on the American fleet
were eight long twelve-pounders, while twenty-four
of the British guns threw only nine-pound shot, or
less. The American broadside threw at close range
about nine hundred pounds of metal; the British
threw about four hundred and sixty. At long range
the Americans threw two hundred and eighty-eight
pounds of metal; the British threw one hundred and
ninety-five pounds. In tonnage the Americans were
superior as eight to seven. In short, the Navy Department
had done everything reasonably necessary
to insure success; and if the American crews, like
the British, were partly made up of landsmen, soldiers
or volunteers, the reason was in each case the
same. Both governments supplied all the seamen
they had.</p>

<p>Between forces so matched, victory ought not to
have been in doubt; and if it was so, the fault certainly
lay not in Perry. When, at daylight September
10, his look-out discovered the British fleet, Perry
got his own squadron under way, and came down
with a light wind from the southeast against Barclay’s
line, striking it obliquely near the head. Perry
must have been anxious to fight at close range, where
his superiority was as two to one, while at long range
his ship could use only two long twelve-pounders
against the “Detroit’s” six twelves, one eighteen, and
two twenty-fours,—an inferiority amounting to helplessness.
Both the “Lawrence” and the “Niagara”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
were armed for close fighting, and were intended for
nothing else. At long range their combined broadside,
even if all their twelve-pounders were worked
on one side, threw but forty-eight pounds of metal;
at short range the two brigs were able to throw six
hundred and forty pounds at each broadside.</p>

<p>Perry could not have meant to fight at a distance,
nor could Commander Elliott have thought it good
seamanship. Yet Perry alone acted on this evident
scheme; and though his official account showed that
he had himself fought at close range, and that he
ordered the other commanders to do the same, it gave
no sufficient reasons to explain what prevented the
whole fleet from acting together, and made the result
doubtful. He did not even mention that he himself
led the line in the “Lawrence,” with two gunboats,
the “Ariel” and the “Scorpion,” supporting him,
the “Caledonia,” “Niagara,” and three gunboats following.
The “Lawrence” came within range of the
British line just at noon, the wind being very light,
the Lake calm, and Barclay, in the “Detroit,” opposite.
Perry’s report began at that <span class="locked">point:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At fifteen minutes before twelve the enemy commenced
firing; at five minutes before twelve the action
commenced on our part. Finding their fire very destructive,
owing to their long guns, and its being mostly
directed to the ‘Lawrence,’ I made sail (at quarter-past
twelve) and directed the other vessels to follow, for the
purpose of closing with the enemy. Every brace and
bowline being shot away, she became unmanageable,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span>
notwithstanding the great exertions of the sailing-master.
In this situation she sustained the action upwards of two
hours, within canister-shot distance, until every gun was
rendered useless, and a greater part of the crew either
killed or wounded. Finding she could no longer annoy
the enemy, I left her in charge of Lieutenant Yarnall,
who, I was convinced from the bravery already displayed
by him, would do what would comport with the honor
of the flag. At half-past two, the wind springing up,
Captain Elliott was enabled to bring his vessel, the
‘Niagara,’ gallantly into close action. I immediately
went on board of her, when he anticipated my wish by
volunteering to bring the schooners, which had been kept
astern by the lightness of the wind, into close action....
At forty-five minutes past two the signal was made
for ‘close action.’ The ‘Niagara’ being very little injured,
I determined to pass through the enemy’s line;
bore up, and passed ahead of their two ships and a brig,
giving a raking fire to them from the starboard guns, and
to a large schooner and sloop, from the larboard side,
at half pistol-shot distance. The smaller vessels at this
time having got within grape and canister distance, under
the direction of Captain Elliott, and keeping up a well-directed
fire, the two ships, a brig, and a schooner surrendered,
a schooner and sloop making a vain attempt
to escape.”</p>
</div>

<p>From this reticent report, any careful reader could
see that for some reason, not so distinctly given as
would have been the case if the wind alone were at
fault, the action had been very badly fought on the
American side. The British official account confirmed
the impression given by Perry. Barclay’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_124">124</span>
story was as well told as his action was well
<span class="locked">fought:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At a quarter before twelve I commenced the action
by a few long guns; about a quarter-past, the American
commodore, also supported by two schooners, ... came
to close action with the ‘Detroit.’ The other brig [the
‘Niagara’] of the enemy, apparently destined to engage
the ‘Queen Charlotte,’ kept so far to windward as to
render the ‘Queen Charlotte’s’ twenty-four pounder carronades
useless, while she was, with the ‘Lady Prevost,’
exposed to the heavy and destructive fire of the ‘Caledonia’
and four other schooners, armed with heavy and
long guns.... The action continued with great fury
until half-past two, when I perceived my opponent [the
‘Lawrence’] drop astern, and a boat passing from him
to the ‘Niagara,’ which vessel was at this time perfectly
fresh. The American commodore, seeing that as yet the
day was against him, ... made a noble and, alas! too
successful an effort to regain it; for he bore up, and supported
by his small vessels, passed within pistol-shot and
took a raking position on our bow.... The weather-gage
gave the enemy a prodigious advantage, as it enabled
them not only to choose their position, but their
distance also, which they [the ‘Caledonia,’ ‘Niagara,’
and the gunboats] did in such a manner as to prevent
the carronades of the ‘Queen Charlotte’ and ‘Lady
Prevost’ from having much effect, while their long ones
did great execution, particularly against the ‘Queen
Charlotte.’”</p>
</div>

<p>Barclay’s report, agreeing with Perry’s, made it
clear that while Perry and the head of the American
line fought at close quarters, the “Caledonia,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
“Niagara,” and the four gunboats supporting them
preferred fighting at long range,—not because they
wanted wind, but because the “Caledonia” and gunboats
were armed with long thirty-two and twenty-four
pounders, while the British vessels opposed to
them had only one or two long twelve-pounders.
Certainly the advantage in this respect on the side
of the American brig and gunboats was enormous;
but these tactics threw the “Niagara,” which had not
the same excuse, out of the battle, leaving her, from
twelve o’clock till half-past two, firing only two
twelve-pound guns, while her heavy armament was
useless, and might as well have been left ashore.
Worse than this, the persistence of the “Caledonia,”
“Niagara,” and their gunboats in keeping, beyond
range of their enemies’ carronades nearly lost the
battle, by allowing the British to concentrate on the
“Lawrence” all their heavy guns, and in the end
compelling the “Lawrence” to strike. On all these
points no reasonable doubt could exist. The two
reports were the only official sources of information
on which an opinion as to the merits of the action
could properly be founded. No other account, contemporaneous
and authoritative, threw light on the
subject, except a letter by Lieutenant Yarnall, second
in command to Perry on the “Lawrence,” written
September 15, and published in the Ohio newspapers
about September 29,—in which Yarnall said that if
Elliott had brought his ship into action when the
signal was given, the battle would have ended in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
much less time, and with less loss to the “Lawrence.”
This statement agreed with the tenor of
the two official reports.</p>

<p>Furious as the battle was, a more furious dispute
raged over it when in the year 1834 the friends of
Perry and of Elliott wrangled over the action. With
their dispute history need not concern itself. The
official reports left no reasonable doubt that Perry’s
plan of battle was correct; that want of wind was
not the reason it failed; but that the “Niagara” was
badly managed by Elliott, and that the victory, when
actually forfeited by this mismanagement, was saved
by the personal energy of Perry, who, abandoning his
own ship, brought the “Niagara” through the enemy’s
line, and regained the advantage of her heavy
battery. The luck which attended Perry’s career on
the Lake saved him from injury, when every other
officer on the two opposing flagships and four-fifths
of his crew were killed or wounded, and enabled him
to perform a feat almost without parallel in naval
warfare, giving him a well-won immortality by means
of the disaster unnecessarily incurred. No process
of argument or ingenuity of seamanship could deprive
Perry of the fame justly given him by the public,
or detract from the splendor of his reputation as
the hero of the war. More than any other battle of
the time, the victory on Lake Erie was won by the
courage and obstinacy of a single man.</p>

<p>Between two opponents such as Perry and Barclay,
no one doubted that the ships were fought to their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span>
utmost. Of the “Lawrence” not much was left;
ship, officers, and crew were shot to pieces. Such
carnage was not known on the ocean, for even the
cockpit where the sick and wounded lay, being above
water, was riddled by shot, and the wounded were
wounded again on the surgeon’s board. Of one
hundred and three effectives on the “Lawrence,”
twenty-two were killed and sixty-one wounded. The
brig herself when she struck was a wreck, unmanageable,
her starboard bulwarks beaten in, guns dismounted,
and rigging cut to pieces. The British
ships were in hardly better condition. The long
guns of the gunboats had raked them with destructive
effect. Barclay was desperately wounded; Finnis
was killed; Barclay’s first lieutenant was mortally
wounded; not one commander or second in command
could keep the deck; the squadron had forty-one men
killed and ninety-four wounded, or nearly one man in
three; the “Detroit” and “Queen Charlotte” were
unmanageable and fell foul; the “Lady Prevost”
was crippled, and drifted out of the fight. Perry
could console himself with the thought that if his
ship had struck her flag, she had at least struck to
brave men.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_VI"><span id="toclink_128"></span>CHAPTER VI.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">General Harrison</span>, waiting at Seneca on the
Sandusky River, received, September 12, Perry’s
famous despatch of September 10: “We have met
the enemy, and they are ours.” The navy having
done its work, the army was next to act.</p>

<p>The force under Harrison’s command was ample
for the required purpose, although it contained fewer
regular troops than Armstrong had intended. The
seven regular regiments assigned to Harrison fell
short in numbers of the most moderate expectations.
Instead of providing seven thousand rank-and-file,
the recruiting service ended in producing rather more
than twenty-five hundred.<a id="FNanchor_122" href="#Footnote_122" class="fnanchor">122</a> Divided into two brigades
under Brigadier-Generals McArthur and Lewis
Cass, with a light corps under Lieutenant-Colonel
Ball of the Light Dragoons, they formed only one
wing of Harrison’s army.</p>

<p>To supply his main force, Harrison had still to
depend on Kentucky; and once more that State
made a great effort. Governor Shelby took the
field in person, leading three thousand volunteers,<a id="FNanchor_123" href="#Footnote_123" class="fnanchor">123</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
organized in eleven regiments, five brigades, and
two divisions. Besides the militia, who volunteered
for this special purpose, Harrison obtained the services
of another Kentucky corps, which had already
proved its efficiency.</p>

<p>One of Armstrong’s happiest acts, at the beginning
of his service as War Secretary,<a id="FNanchor_124" href="#Footnote_124" class="fnanchor">124</a> was to accept
the aid of Richard M. Johnson in organizing
for frontier defence a mounted regiment of a thousand
men, armed with muskets or rifles, tomahawks,
and knives.<a id="FNanchor_125" href="#Footnote_125" class="fnanchor">125</a> Johnson and his regiment
took the field about June 1, and from that time
anxiety on account of Indians ceased. The regiment
patrolled the district from Fort Wayne to
the river Raisin, and whether in marching or fighting
proved to be the most efficient corps in the
Western country. Harrison obtained the assistance
of Johnson’s regiment for the movement into
Canada, and thereby increased the efficiency of
his army beyond the proportion of Johnson’s
numbers.</p>

<p>While the mounted regiment moved by the road
to Detroit, Harrison’s main force was embarked in
boats September 20, and in the course of a few
days some forty-five hundred infantry were safely
conveyed by way of Bass Island and Put-in-Bay
to Middle Sister Island, about twelve miles from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span>
the Canadian shore.<a id="FNanchor_126" href="#Footnote_126" class="fnanchor">126</a> Harrison and Perry then
selected a landing place, and the whole force was
successfully set ashore, September 27, about three
miles below Malden.</p>

<p>Although Proctor could not hope to maintain
himself at Malden or Detroit without control of the
Lake, he had still the means of rendering Harrison’s
possession insecure. According to the British account,
he commanded at Detroit and Malden a force
of nine hundred and eighty-six regulars, giving about
eight hundred effectives.<a id="FNanchor_127" href="#Footnote_127" class="fnanchor">127</a> Not less than thirty-five
hundred Indian warriors had flocked to Amherstburg,
and although they greatly increased the British
general’s difficulties by bringing their families with
them, they might be formidable opponents to Harrison’s
advance. Every motive dictated to Proctor
the necessity of resisting Harrison’s approach. To
Tecumthe and his Indians the evacuation of Malden
and Detroit without a struggle meant not only the
sacrifice of their cause, but also cowardice; and when
Proctor announced to them, September 18, that he
meant to retreat, Tecumthe rose in the council and
protested against the flight, likening Proctor to a
fat dog that had carried its tail erect, and now that
it was frightened dropped its tail between its legs
and ran.<a id="FNanchor_128" href="#Footnote_128" class="fnanchor">128</a> He told Proctor to go if he liked, but the
Indians would remain.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_131">131</span></p>

<p>Proctor insisted upon retiring at least toward the
Moravian town, seventy miles on the road to Lake
Ontario, and the Indians yielded. The troops immediately
began to burn or destroy the public property
at Detroit and Malden, or to load on wagons or
boats what could not be carried away. September
24, three days before Harrison’s army landed, the
British evacuated Malden and withdrew to Sandwich,
allowing Harrison to establish himself at Malden
without a skirmish, and neglecting to destroy the
bridge over the Canards River.</p>

<p>Harrison was surprised at Proctor’s tame retreat.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Nothing but infatuation,” he reported,<a id="FNanchor_129" href="#Footnote_129" class="fnanchor">129</a> “could have
governed General Proctor’s conduct. The day that I
landed below Malden he had at his disposal upward of
three thousand Indian warriors; his regular force reinforced
by the militia of the district would have made
his number nearly equal to my aggregate, which on the
day of landing did not exceed forty-five hundred....
His inferior officers say that his conduct has been a series
of continued blunders.”</p>
</div>

<p>This crowning proof of Proctor’s incapacity disorganized
his force. Tecumthe expressed a general
sentiment of the British army in his public denunciation
of Proctor’s cowardice. One of the inferior
British officers afterward declared that Proctor’s
“marked inefficiency” and “wanton sacrifice” of
the troops raised more than a doubt not only of
his capacity but even of his personal courage, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span>
led to serious thoughts of taking away his authority.<a id="FNanchor_130" href="#Footnote_130" class="fnanchor">130</a>
The British at Sandwich went through the
same experience that marked the retreat of Hull
and his army from the same spot, only the year
before.</p>

<p>Harrison on his side made no extreme haste to
pursue. His army marched into Malden at four
o’clock on the afternoon of September 27,<a id="FNanchor_131" href="#Footnote_131" class="fnanchor">131</a> and he
wrote to Secretary Armstrong that evening: “I
will pursue the enemy to-morrow, although there is
no probability of my overtaking him, as he has upwards
of a thousand horses, and we have not one
in the army.”<a id="FNanchor_132" href="#Footnote_132" class="fnanchor">132</a> The pursuit was not rapid. Sandwich,
opposite Detroit, was only thirteen miles above
Malden, but Harrison required two days to reach
it, arriving at two o’clock on the afternoon of September
29. From there, September 30, he wrote
again to Secretary Armstrong that he was preparing
to pursue the enemy on the following day;<a id="FNanchor_133" href="#Footnote_133" class="fnanchor">133</a> but he
waited for R.&nbsp;M. Johnson’s mounted regiment, which
arrived at Detroit September 30, and was obliged
to consume a day in crossing the river. Then the
pursuit began with energy, but on the morning of
October 2 Proctor had already a week’s advance
and should have been safe.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>

<p>Proctor seemed to imagine that the Americans
would not venture to pursue him. Moving, according
to his own report,<a id="FNanchor_134" href="#Footnote_134" class="fnanchor">134</a> “by easy marches,” neither
obstructing the road in his rear nor leaving detachments
to delay the enemy, he reached Dolson’s
October 1, and there halted his army, fifty miles
from Sandwich, while he went to the Moravian
town some twenty-six miles beyond. He then intended
to make a stand at Chatham, three miles
behind Dolson’s.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had assured the Indians,” said Proctor’s report of
October 23, “that we would not desert them, and it was
my full determination to have made a stand at the Forks
(Chatham), by which our vessels and stores would be protected;
but after my arrival at Dover [Dolson’s] three
miles lower down the river, I was induced to take post
there first, where ovens had been constructed, and where
there was some shelter for the troops, and had accordingly
directed that it should be put into the best possible
state of defence that time and circumstances would admit
of; indeed it had been my intention to have opposed the
enemy nearer the mouth of the river, had not the troops
contrary to my intention been moved, during my absence
of a few hours for the purpose of acquiring some knowledge
of the country in my rear.”</p>
</div>

<p>The British army, left at Dolson’s October 1, without
a general or orders,<a id="FNanchor_135" href="#Footnote_135" class="fnanchor">135</a> saw the American army
arrive in its front, October 3, and retired three<span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span>
miles to Chatham, where the Indians insisted upon
fighting; but when, the next morning, October 4,
the Americans advanced in order of battle,<a id="FNanchor_136" href="#Footnote_136" class="fnanchor">136</a> the
Indians after a skirmish changed their minds and
retreated. The British were compelled to sacrifice
the supplies they had brought by water to Chatham
for establishing their new base, and their retreat
precipitated on the Moravian town the confusion of
flight already resembling rout.</p>

<p>Six miles on their way they met General Proctor
returning from the Moravian town, and as much
dissatisfied with them as they with him. Pressed
closely by the American advance, the British troops
made what haste they could over excessively bad
roads until eight o’clock in the evening, when they
halted within six miles of the Moravian town.<a id="FNanchor_137" href="#Footnote_137" class="fnanchor">137</a> The
next morning, October 5, the enemy was again reported
to be close at hand, and the British force
again retreated. About a mile and a half from the
Moravian town it was halted. Proctor had then
retired as far as he could, and there he must either
fight, or abandon women and children, sick and
wounded, baggage, stores, and wagons, desert his
Indian allies, and fly to Lake Ontario. Probably
flight would not have saved his troops. More than
a hundred miles of unsettled country lay between
them and their next base. The Americans had in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span>
their advance the mounted regiment of R.&nbsp;M. Johnson,
and could outmarch the most lightly equipped
British regulars. Already, according to Proctor’s
report, the rapidity of the Americans had destroyed
the efficiency of the British <span class="locked">organization:<a id="FNanchor_138" href="#Footnote_138" class="fnanchor">138</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the attempt to save provisions we became encumbered
with boats not suited to the state of navigation.
The Indians and the troops retreated on
different sides of the river, and the boats to which
sufficient attention had not been given became particularly
exposed to the fire of the enemy who were
advancing on the side the Indians were retiring, and
most unfortunately fell into possession of the enemy,
and with them several of the men, provisions, and all
the ammunition that had not been issued to the troops
and Indians. This disastrous circumstance afforded the
enemy the means of crossing and advancing on both
sides of the river. Finding the enemy were advancing
too near I resolved to meet him, being strong in cavalry,
in a wood below the Moravian town, which last was not
cleared of Indian women and children, or of those of
the troops, nor of the sick.”</p>
</div>

<p>The whole British force was then on the north
bank of the river Thames, retreating eastward by a
road near the river bank. Proctor could hardly claim
to have exercised choice in the selection of a battleground,
unless he preferred placing his little force
under every disadvantage. “The troops were formed
with their left to the river,” his report continued,
“with a reserve and a six-pounder on the road, near<span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span>
the river; the Indians on the right.” According to
the report of officers of the Forty-first regiment, two
lines of troops were formed in a thick forest, two
hundred yards apart. The first line began where
the six-pound field-piece stood, with a range of some
fifty yards along the road. A few Canadian Light
Dragoons were stationed near the gun. To the left
of the road was the river; to the right a forest, free
from underbrush that could stop horsemen, but offering
cover to an approaching enemy within twenty
paces of the British line.<a id="FNanchor_139" href="#Footnote_139" class="fnanchor">139</a> In the wood about two
hundred men of the British Forty-first took position
as well as they could, behind trees, and there as
a first line they waited some two hours for their
enemy to appear.</p>

<p>The second line, somewhat less numerous, two
hundred yards behind the first, and not within sight,
was also formed in the wood; and on the road, in
rear of the second line, Proctor and his staff stationed
themselves. The Indians were collected behind a
swamp on the right, touching and covering effectually
the British right flank, while the river covered
the left.</p>

<p>Such a formation was best fitted for Harrison’s
purposes, but the mere arrangement gave little idea
of Proctor’s weakness. The six-pound field-piece,
which as he afterward reported “certainly should
have produced the best effect if properly managed,”
had not a round of ammunition, and could not be<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span>
fired.<a id="FNanchor_140" href="#Footnote_140" class="fnanchor">140</a> The Forty-first regiment was almost mutinous,
but had it been in the best condition it could
not have held against serious attack. The whole
strength of the Forty-first was only three hundred
and fifty-six rank-and-file, or four hundred and eight
men all told.<a id="FNanchor_141" href="#Footnote_141" class="fnanchor">141</a> The numbers of the regiment actually
in the field were reported as three hundred and
fifteen rank-and-file, or three hundred and sixty-seven
men all told.<a id="FNanchor_142" href="#Footnote_142" class="fnanchor">142</a> The dragoons were supposed not to
exceed twenty. This petty force was unable to see
either the advancing enemy or its own members.
The only efficient corps in the field was the Indians,
who were estimated by the British sometimes at five
hundred, at eight hundred, and twelve hundred in
number, and who were in some degree covered by
the swamp.</p>

<p>Harrison came upon the British line soon after two
o’clock in the afternoon, and at once formed his army
in regular order of battle. As the order was disregarded,
and the battle was fought, as he reported, in
a manner “not sanctioned by anything that I had
seen or heard of,”<a id="FNanchor_143" href="#Footnote_143" class="fnanchor">143</a> the intended arrangement mattered
little. In truth, the battle was planned as well
as fought by Richard M. Johnson, whose energy impressed
on the army a new character from the moment
he joined it. While Harrison drew up his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_138">138</span>
infantry in order of battle, Johnson, whose mounted
regiment was close to the British line, asked leave to
charge,<a id="FNanchor_144" href="#Footnote_144" class="fnanchor">144</a> and Harrison gave him the order, although he
knew no rule of war that sanctioned it.</p>

<p>Johnson’s tactics were hazardous, though effective.
Giving to his brother, James Johnson, half the regiment
to lead up the road against the six-pound gun
and the British Forty-first regiment, R.&nbsp;M. Johnson
with the other half of his regiment wheeled to the
left, at an angle with the road, and crossed the
swamp to attack twice his number of Indians posted
in a thick wood.</p>

<p>James Johnson, with his five hundred men, galloped
directly through the British first line,<a id="FNanchor_145" href="#Footnote_145" class="fnanchor">145</a> receiving a
confused fire, and passing immediately to the rear
of the British second line, so rapidly as almost to
capture Proctor himself, who fled at full speed.<a id="FNanchor_146" href="#Footnote_146" class="fnanchor">146</a> As
the British soldiers straggled in bands or singly
toward the rear, they found themselves among the
American mounted riflemen, and had no choice but
to surrender. About fifty men, with a single lieutenant,
contrived to escape through the woods; all the
rest became prisoners.</p>

<p>R.&nbsp;M. Johnson was less fortunate. Crossing the
swamp to his left, he was received by the Indians in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span>
underbrush which the horses could not penetrate.
Under a sharp fire his men were obliged to dismount
and fight at close quarters. At an early moment of
the battle, Johnson was wounded by the rifle of an
Indian warrior who sprang forward to despatch him,
but was killed by a ball from Johnson’s pistol. The
fighting at that point was severe, but Johnson’s men
broke or turned the Indian line, which was uncovered
after the British defeat, and driving the Indians toward
the American left, brought them under fire of
Shelby’s infantry, when they fled.</p>

<p>In this contest Johnson maintained that his regiment
was alone engaged. In a letter to Secretary
Armstrong, dated six weeks after the battle, he
<span class="locked">said:<a id="FNanchor_147" href="#Footnote_147" class="fnanchor">147</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I send you an imperfect sketch of the late battle on
the river Thames, fought solely by the mounted regiment;
at least, so much so that not fifty men from any other
corps assisted.... Fought the Indians, twelve hundred
or fifteen hundred men, one hour and twenty minutes,
driving them from the extreme right to the extreme
left of my line, at which last point we came near Governor
Shelby, who ordered Colonel Simrall to reinforce
me; but the battle was over, and although the Indians
were pursued half a mile, there was no fighting.”</p>
</div>

<p>Harrison’s official report gave another idea of the
relative share taken by the Kentucky infantry in the
action; but the difference in dispute was trifling.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>
The entire American loss was supposed to be only
about fifteen killed and thirty wounded. The battle
lasted, with sharpness, not more than twenty minutes;
and none but the men under Johnson’s command enjoyed
opportunity to share in the first and most
perilous assault.</p>

<p>The British loss was only twelve men killed and
thirty-six wounded. The total number of British
prisoners taken on the field and in the Moravian town,
or elsewhere on the day of battle, was four hundred
and seventy-seven; in the whole campaign, six hundred.
All Proctor’s baggage, artillery, small arms,
stores, and hospital were captured in the Moravian
town. The Indians left thirty-three dead on the field,
among them one reported to be Tecumthe. After
the battle several officers of the British Forty-first,
well acquainted with the Shawnee warrior, visited the
spot, and identified his body. The Kentuckians had
first recognized it, and had cut long strips of skin
from the thighs, to keep, as was said, for razor-straps,
in memory of the river Raisin.<a id="FNanchor_148" href="#Footnote_148" class="fnanchor">148</a></p>

<p>After Perry’s victory on Lake Erie, Tecumthe’s life
was of no value to himself or his people, and his
death was no subject for regret; but the manner
chosen for producing this result was an expensive
mode of acquiring territory for the United States.
The Shawnee warrior compelled the government to
pay for once something like the value of the lands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
it took. The precise cost of the Indian war could
not be estimated, being combined in many ways
with that of the war with England; but the British
counted for little, within the northwestern territory,
except so far as Tecumthe used them for his purposes.
Not more than seven or eight hundred British
soldiers ever crossed the Detroit River; but the
United States raised fully twenty thousand men, and
spent at least five million dollars and many lives in
expelling them. The Indians alone made this outlay
necessary. The campaign of Tippecanoe, the
surrender of Detroit and Mackinaw, the massacres
at Fort Dearborn, the river Raisin, and Fort Meigs,
the murders along the frontier, and the campaign
of 1813 were the price paid for the Indian lands in
the Wabash Valley.</p>

<p>No part of the war more injured British credit on
the American continent than the result of the Indian
alliance. Except the capture of Detroit and Mackinaw
at the outset, without fighting, and the qualified
success at the river Raisin, the British suffered only
mortifications, ending with the total loss of their fleet,
the abandonment of their fortress, the flight of their
army, and the shameful scene before the Moravian
town, where four hundred British regulars allowed
themselves to be ridden over and captured by five
hundred Kentucky horsemen, with hardly the loss of
a man to the assailants. After such a disgrace the
British ceased to be formidable in the northwest.
The Indians recognized the hopelessness of their<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>
course, and from that moment abandoned their dependence
on England.</p>

<p>The battle of the Thames annihilated the right
division of the British army in Upper Canada. When
the remnants of Proctor’s force were mustered, October
17, at Ancaster, a hundred miles from the battlefield,
about two hundred rank-and-file were assembled.<a id="FNanchor_149" href="#Footnote_149" class="fnanchor">149</a>
Proctor made a report of the battle blaming his
troops, and Prevost issued a severe reprimand to the
unfortunate Forty-first regiment on the strength of
Proctor’s representations. In the end the Prince
Regent disgraced both officers, recognizing by these
public acts the loss of credit the government had
suffered; but its recovery was impossible.</p>

<p>So little anxiety did General Harrison thenceforward
feel about the Eighth Military District which he
commanded, that he returned to Detroit October 7;
his army followed him, and arrived at Sandwich,
October 10, without seeing an enemy. Promptly discharged,
the Kentucky Volunteers marched homeward
October 14; the mounted regiment and its wounded
colonel followed a few days later, and within a fortnight
only two brigades of the regular army remained
north of the Maumee.</p>

<p>At Detroit the war was closed, and except for two
or three distant expeditions was not again a subject
of interest. The Indians were for the most part
obliged to remain within the United States jurisdiction.
The great number of Indian families that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span>
had been collected about Detroit and Malden were
rather a cause for confidence than fear, since they
were in effect hostages, and any violence committed
by the warriors would have caused them, their women
and children, to be deprived of food and to perish
of starvation. Detroit was full of savages dependent
on army supplies, and living on the refuse and offal
of the slaughter-yard; but their military strength
was gone. Some hundreds of the best warriors followed
Proctor to Lake Ontario, but Tecumthe’s northwestern
confederacy was broken up, and most of the
tribes made submission.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> new Secretaries of War and Navy who took
office in January, 1813, were able in the following
October to show Detroit recovered. Nine months
solved the problem of Lake Erie. The problem of
Lake Ontario remained insoluble.</p>

<p>In theory nothing was simpler than the conquest
of Upper Canada. Six months before war was declared,
Jan. 2, 1812, John Armstrong, then a private
citizen, wrote to Secretary Eustis a letter containing
the <span class="locked">remark,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In invading a neighboring and independent territory
like Canada, having a frontier of immense extent; destitute
of means strictly its own for the purposes of
defence; separated from the rest of the empire by an
ocean, and having to this but one outlet,—this outlet
forms your true object or point of attack.”</p>
</div>

<p>The river St. Lawrence was the true object of
attack, and the Canadians hardly dared hope to defend
it.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“From St. Regis to opposite Kingston,” said the
Quebec “Gazette” in 1814, “the southern bank of the
river belongs to the United States. It is well known
that this river is the only communication between Upper
and Lower Canada. It is rapid and narrow in many<span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span>
places. A few cannon judiciously posted, or even
musketry, could render the communication impracticable
without powerful escorts, wasting and parcelling the force
applicable to the defence of the provinces. It is needless
to say that no British force can remain in safety or maintain
itself in Upper Canada without a ready communication
with the lower province.”</p>
</div>

<p>Closure of the river anywhere must compel the
submission of the whole country above, which could
not provide its supplies. The American, who saw his
own difficulties of transport between New York and
the Lakes, thought well of his energy in surmounting
them; but as the war took larger proportions, and
great fleets were built on Lake Ontario, the difficulties
of Canadian transport became insuperable.
Toward the close of the war, Sir George Prevost
wrote to Lord Bathurst<a id="FNanchor_150" href="#Footnote_150" class="fnanchor">150</a> that six thirty-two-pound
guns for the fleet, hauled in winter four hundred
miles from Quebec to Kingston, would cost at least
£2000 for transport. Forty twenty-four-pounders
hauled on the snow had cost £4,800; a cable of
the largest size hauled from Sorel to Kingston, two
hundred and fifty-five miles, cost £1000 for transport.
In summer, when the river was open, the
difficulties were hardly less. The commissary-general
reported that the impediments of navigation were
incalculable, and the scarcity of workmen, laborers,
and voyageurs not to be described.<a id="FNanchor_151" href="#Footnote_151" class="fnanchor">151</a></p>

<p>If these reasons for attacking and closing the river
St. Lawrence had not been decisive with the United
States government, other reasons were sufficient.
The political motive was as strong as the military.
Americans, especially in New England, denied that
treasonable intercourse existed with Canada; but
intercourse needed not to be technically treasonable
in order to have the effects of treason. Sir George
Prevost wrote to Lord Bathurst, Aug. 27, 1814,<a id="FNanchor_152" href="#Footnote_152" class="fnanchor">152</a>
when the war had lasted two <span class="locked">years,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Two thirds of the army in Canada are at this moment
eating beef provided by American contractors,
drawn principally from the States of Vermont and New
York. This circumstance, as well as that of the introduction
of large sums of specie into this province, being
notorious in the United States, it is to be expected Congress
will take steps to deprive us of those resources, and
under that apprehension, large droves are daily crossing
the lines coming into Lower Canada.”</p>
</div>

<p>This state of things had then lasted during three
campaigns, from the beginning of the war. The
Indians at Malden, the British army at Niagara, the
naval station at Kingston were largely fed by the
United States. If these supplies could be stopped,
Upper Canada must probably fall; and they could
be easily stopped by interrupting the British line
of transport anywhere on the St. Lawrence.</p>

<p>The task was not difficult. Indeed, early in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
war an enterprising officer of irregulars, Major Benjamin
Forsyth, carried on a troublesome system of
annoyance from Ogdensburg, which Sir George Prevost
treated with extreme timidity.<a id="FNanchor_153" href="#Footnote_153" class="fnanchor">153</a> The British
commandant at Prescott, Major Macdonnell, was not
so cautious as the governor-general, but crossed the
river on the ice with about five hundred men, drove
Forsyth from the town, destroyed the public property,
and retired in safety with a loss of eight killed and
fifty-two wounded.<a id="FNanchor_154" href="#Footnote_154" class="fnanchor">154</a> This affair, Feb. 23, 1813, closed
hostilities in that region, and Major Forsyth was soon
ordered to Sackett’s Harbor. His experience, and
that of Major Macdonnell, proved how easy the closure
of such a river must be, exposed as it was
for two hundred miles to the fire of cannon and
musketry.</p>

<p>The St. Lawrence was therefore the proper point
of approach and attack against Upper Canada. Armstrong
came to the Department of War with that
idea fixed in his mind. The next subject for his
consideration was the means at his disposal.</p>

<p>During Monroe’s control of the War Department
for two months, between Dec. 3, 1812, and Feb. 5,
1813, much effort had been made to increase the
army. Monroe wrote to the chairman of the Military
Committee Dec. 22, 1812, a sketch of his ideas.<a id="FNanchor_155" href="#Footnote_155" class="fnanchor">155</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span>
He proposed to provide for the general defence by dividing
the United States into military districts, and
apportioning ninety-three hundred and fifty men
among them as garrisons. For offensive operations
he required a force competent to overpower the British
defence, and in estimating his wants, he assumed
that Canada contained about twelve thousand British
regulars, besides militia, and three thousand men
at Halifax.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To demolish the British force from Niagara to
Quebec,” said Monroe, “would require, to make the
thing secure, an efficient regular army of twenty thousand
men, with an army of reserve of ten thousand....
If the government could raise and keep in the field thirty-five
thousand regular troops, ... the deficiency to be
supplied even to authorize an expedition against Halifax
would be inconsiderable. Ten thousand men would be
amply sufficient; but there is danger of not being able to
raise that force, and to keep it at that standard....
My idea is that provision ought to be made for
raising twenty thousand men in addition to the present
establishment.”</p>
</div>

<p>Congress voted about fifty-eight thousand men, and
after deducting ten thousand for garrisons, counted
on forty-eight thousand for service in Canada. When
Armstrong took control, Feb. 5, 1813, he began at
once to devise a plan of operation for the army which
by law numbered fifty-eight thousand men, and in
fact numbered, including the staff and regimental
officers, eighteen thousand nine hundred and forty-five<span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span>
men, according to the returns in the adjutant-general’s
office February 16, 1813. Before he had
been a week in the War Department, he wrote, February
10, to Major-General Dearborn announcing that
four thousand men were to be immediately collected
at Sackett’s Harbor, and three thousand at Buffalo.
April 1, or as soon as navigation opened, the four
thousand troops at Sackett’s Harbor were to be embarked
and transported in boats under convoy of
the fleet across the Lake at the mouth of the St.
Lawrence, thirty-five miles, to Kingston. After capturing
Kingston, with its magazines, navy-yards, and
ships, the expedition was to proceed up the Lake to
York (Toronto) and capture two vessels building
there. Thence it was to join the corps of three
thousand men at Buffalo, and attack the British on
the Niagara River.<a id="FNanchor_156" href="#Footnote_156" class="fnanchor">156</a></p>

<p>In explaining his plan to the Cabinet, Armstrong
pointed out that the attack from Lake Champlain on
Montreal could not begin before May 1; that Kingston,
between April 1 and May 15, was shut from
support by ice; that not more than two thousand
men could be gathered to defend it; and that by beginning
the campaign against Kingston rather than
against Montreal, six weeks’ time would be gained
before reinforcements could arrive from England.<a id="FNanchor_157" href="#Footnote_157" class="fnanchor">157</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>

<p>Whatever defects the plan might have, Kingston,
and Kingston alone, possessed so much military
importance as warranted the movement. Evidently
Armstrong had in mind no result short of the capture
of Kingston.</p>

<p>Dearborn received these instructions at Albany,
and replied, February 18, that nothing should be
omitted on his part in endeavoring to carry into
effect the expedition proposed.<a id="FNanchor_158" href="#Footnote_158" class="fnanchor">158</a> Orders were given
for concentrating the intended force at Sackett’s
Harbor. During the month of March the preparations
were stimulated by a panic due to the appearance
of Sir George Prevost at Prescott and Kingston.
Dearborn hurried to Sackett’s Harbor in person, under
the belief that the governor-general was about
to attack it.</p>

<p>Armstrong estimated the British force at Kingston
as nine hundred regulars, or two thousand men all
told; and his estimate was probably correct. The
usual garrison at Kingston and Prescott was about
eight hundred rank-and-file. In both the British and
American services, the returns of rank-and-file were
the ordinary gauge of numerical force. Rank-and-file
included corporals, but not sergeants or commissioned
officers; and an allowance of at least ten
sergeants and officers was always to be made for
every hundred rank-and-file, in order to estimate the
true numerical strength of an army or garrison. Unless
otherwise mentioned, the return excluded also<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>
the sick and disabled. The relative force of every
army was given in effectives, or rank-and-file actually
present for duty.</p>

<p>In the distribution of British forces in Canada for
1812–1813, the garrison at Prescott was allowed three
hundred and seventy-six rank-and-file, with fifty-two
officers including sergeants. To Kingston three
hundred and eighty-four rank-and-file were allotted,
with sixty officers including sergeants. To Montreal
and the positions between Prescott and the St. John’s
River about five thousand rank-and-file were allotted.<a id="FNanchor_159" href="#Footnote_159" class="fnanchor">159</a>
At Prescott and Kingston, besides the regular troops,
the men employed in ship-building or other labor, the
sailors, and the local militia were to be reckoned as
part of the garrison, and Armstrong included them all
in his estimate of two thousand men.</p>

<p>The British force should have been known to
Dearborn nearly as well as his own. No considerable
movement of troops between Lower and Upper
Canada could occur without his knowledge. Yet
Dearborn wrote to Armstrong, March 9, 1813, from
Sackett’s <span class="locked">Harbor,<a id="FNanchor_160" href="#Footnote_160" class="fnanchor">160</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have not yet had the honor of a visit from Sir
George Prevost. His whole force is concentrated at
Kingston, probably amounting to six or seven thousand,—about
three thousand of them regular troops. The ice<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span>
is good, and we expect him every day.... As soon as
the fall [fate?] of this place [Sackett’s Harbor] shall be
decided, we shall be able to determine on other measures.
If we hold this place, we will command the Lake, and be
able to act in concert with the troops at Niagara.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later, March 14, Dearborn wrote again.<a id="FNanchor_161" href="#Footnote_161" class="fnanchor">161</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Sir George,” he said, had “concluded that it is too
late to attack this place.... We are probably just
strong enough on each side to defend, but not in sufficient
force to hazard an offensive movement. The difference
of attacking and being attacked, as it regards
the contiguous posts of Kingston and Sackett’s Harbor,
cannot be estimated at less than three or four thousand
men, arising from the circumstance of militia acting
merely on the defensive.”</p>
</div>

<p>Clearly Dearborn did not approve Armstrong’s
plan, and wished to change it. In this idea he
was supported, or instigated, by the naval commander
on the Lake, Isaac Chauncey, a native of Connecticut,
forty years of age, who entered the service in
1798 and became captain in 1806. Chauncey and
Dearborn consulted together, and devised a new
scheme, which Dearborn explained to Armstrong
about March <span class="locked">20:<a id="FNanchor_162" href="#Footnote_162" class="fnanchor">162</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To take or destroy the armed vessels at York will
give us the complete command of the Lake. Commodore
Chauncey can take with him ten or twelve hundred troops
to be commanded by Pike; take York; from thence proceed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
to Niagara and attack Fort George by land and water,
while the troops at Buffalo cross over and carry Forts
Erie and Chippewa, and join those at Fort George; and
then collect our whole force for an attack on Kingston.
After the most mature deliberation the above was considered
by Commodore Chauncey and myself as the most
certain of ultimate success.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus Dearborn and Chauncey inverted Armstrong’s
plan. Instead of attacking on the St. Lawrence, they
proposed to attack on the Niagara. Armstrong acquiesced.
“Taking for granted,” as he did<a id="FNanchor_163" href="#Footnote_163" class="fnanchor">163</a> on Dearborn’s
assertion, “that General Prevost ... has
assembled at Kingston a force of six or eight thousand
men, as stated by you,” he could not require
that his own plan should be pursued. “The alteration
in the plan of campaign so as to make Kingston
the last object instead of making it the first, would
appear to be necessary, or at least proper,” he wrote
to Dearborn, March 29.<a id="FNanchor_164" href="#Footnote_164" class="fnanchor">164</a></p>

<p>The scheme proposed by Dearborn and Chauncey
was carried into effect by them. The contractors
furnished new vessels, which gave to Chauncey for
a time the control of the Lake. April 22 the
troops, numbering sixteen hundred men, embarked.
Armstrong insisted on only one change in the expedition,
which betrayed perhaps a shade of malice,
for he required Dearborn himself to command it,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span>
and Dearborn was suspected of shunning service in
the field.</p>

<p>From the moment Dearborn turned away from
the St. Lawrence and carried the war westward,
the naval and military movements on Lake Ontario
became valuable chiefly as a record of failure. The
fleet and army arrived at York early in the morning
of April 27. York, a village numbering in 1806, according
to British account, more than three thousand
inhabitants, was the capital of Upper Canada,
and contained the residence of the lieutenant-governor
and the two brick buildings where the Legislature
met. For military purposes the place was
valueless, but it had been used for the construction
of a few war-vessels, and Chauncey represented,
through Dearborn, that “to take or destroy the
armed vessels at York will give us the complete
command of the Lake.” The military force at York,
according to British account, did not exceed six hundred
men, regulars and militia; and of these, one
hundred and eighty men, or two companies of the
Eighth or King’s regiment, happened to be there
only in passing.<a id="FNanchor_165" href="#Footnote_165" class="fnanchor">165</a></p>

<p>Under the fire of the fleet and riflemen, Pike’s
brigade was set ashore; the British garrison, after
a sharp resistance, was driven away, and the town
capitulated. The ship on the stocks was burned;
the ten-gun brig “Gloucester” was made prize; the
stores were destroyed or shipped; some three hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span>
prisoners were taken; and the public buildings,
including the houses of Assembly, were burned.
The destruction of the Assembly houses, afterward
alleged as ground for retaliation against the capitol
at Washington, was probably the unauthorized
act of private soldiers. Dearborn protested that it
was done without his knowledge and against his
orders.<a id="FNanchor_166" href="#Footnote_166" class="fnanchor">166</a></p>

<p>The success cost far more than it was worth. The
explosion of a powder magazine, near which the
American advance halted, injured a large number
of men on both sides. Not less than three hundred
and twenty Americans were killed or wounded in the
battle or explosion,<a id="FNanchor_167" href="#Footnote_167" class="fnanchor">167</a> or about one fifth of the entire
force. General Pike, the best brigadier then in the
service, was killed. Only two or three battles in
the entire war were equally bloody.<a id="FNanchor_168" href="#Footnote_168" class="fnanchor">168</a> “Unfortunately
the enemy’s armed ship the ‘Prince Regent,’”
reported Dearborn,<a id="FNanchor_169" href="#Footnote_169" class="fnanchor">169</a> “left this place for Kingston four
days before we arrived.”</p>

<p>Chauncey and Dearborn crossed to Niagara, while
the troops remained some ten days at York, and were
then disembarked at Niagara, May 8, according to
Dearborn’s report, “in a very sickly and depressed
state; a large proportion of the officers and men<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span>
were sickly and debilitated.”<a id="FNanchor_170" href="#Footnote_170" class="fnanchor">170</a> Nothing was ready
for the movement which was to drive the British
from Fort George, and before active operations could
begin, Dearborn fell ill. The details of command fell
to his chief-of-staff, Colonel Winfield Scott.</p>

<p>The military organization at Niagara was at best
unfortunate. One of Secretary Armstrong’s earliest
measures was to issue the military order previously
arranged by Monroe, dividing the Union into military
districts. Vermont and the State of New York north
of the highlands formed the Ninth Military District,
under Major-General Dearborn. In the Ninth District
were three points of activity,—Plattsburg on Lake
Champlain, Sackett’s Harbor on Lake Ontario, and
the Niagara River. Each point required a large force
and a commander of the highest ability; but in May,
1813, Plattsburg and Sackett’s Harbor were denuded
of troops and officers, who were all drawn to Niagara,
where they formed three brigades, commanded by
Brigadier-Generals John P. Boyd, who succeeded Pike,
John Chandler, and W.&nbsp;H. Winder. Niagara and the
troops in its neighborhood were under the command
of Major-General Morgan Lewis, a man of ability, but
possessing neither the youth nor the energy to lead
an army in the field, while Boyd, Chandler, and
Winder were competent only to command regiments.</p>

<p>Winfield Scott in effect assumed control of the
army, and undertook to carry out Van Rensselaer’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_157">157</span>
plan of the year before for attacking Fort George
in the rear, from the Lake. The task was not very
difficult. Chauncey controlled the Lake, and his fleet
was at hand to transfer the troops. Dearborn’s force
numbered certainly not less than four thousand rank-and-file
present for duty. The entire British regular
force on the Niagara River did not exceed eighteen
hundred rank-and-file, and about five hundred militia.<a id="FNanchor_171" href="#Footnote_171" class="fnanchor">171</a>
At Fort George about one thousand regulars
and three hundred militia were stationed, and the
military object to be gained by the Americans was
not so much the capture of Fort George, which was
then not defensible, as that of its garrison.</p>

<p>Early on the morning of May 27, when the mist
cleared away, the British General Vincent saw Chauncey’s
fleet, “in an extended line of more than two
miles,” standing toward the shore. When the ships
took position, “the fire from the shipping so completely
enfiladed and scoured the plains, that it became
impossible to approach the beach,” and Vincent
could only concentrate his force between the Fort and
the enemy, waiting attack. Winfield Scott at the
head of an advance division first landed, followed by
the brigades of Boyd, Winder, and Chandler, and after
a sharp skirmish drove the British back along the
Lake shore, advancing under cover of the fleet. Vincent’s
report <span class="locked">continued:<a id="FNanchor_172" href="#Footnote_172" class="fnanchor">172</a>—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“After awaiting the approach of the enemy for about
half an hour I received authentic information that his
force, consisting of from four to five thousand men, had
reformed his columns and was making an effort to turn
my right flank. Having given orders for the fort to be
evacuated, the guns to be spiked, and the ammunition
destroyed, the troops under my command were put in
motion, and marched across the country in a line parallel
to the Niagara River, toward the position near the Beaver
Dam beyond Queenston mountain.... Having assembled
my whole force the following morning, which did
not exceed sixteen hundred men, I continued my march
toward the head of the Lake.”</p>
</div>

<p>Vincent lost severely in proportion to his numbers,
for fifty-one men were killed, and three hundred
and five were wounded or missing, chiefly in the
Eighth or King’s regiment.<a id="FNanchor_173" href="#Footnote_173" class="fnanchor">173</a> Several hundred militia
were captured in his retreat. The American loss
was about forty killed and one hundred and twenty
wounded. According to General Morgan Lewis, Col.
Winfield Scott “fought nine-tenths of the battle.”<a id="FNanchor_174" href="#Footnote_174" class="fnanchor">174</a>
Dearborn watched the movements from the fleet.</p>

<p>For a time this success made a deep impression on
the military administration of Canada, and the abandonment
of the whole country west of Kingston was
thought inevitable.<a id="FNanchor_175" href="#Footnote_175" class="fnanchor">175</a> The opportunity for achieving
a decided advantage was the best that occurred for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>
the Americans during the entire war; but whatever
might be said in public, the battle of Fort George
was a disappointment to the War Department<a id="FNanchor_176" href="#Footnote_176" class="fnanchor">176</a> as well
as to the officers in command of the American army,
who had hoped to destroy the British force. The
chief advantage gained was the liberation of Perry’s
vessels at Black Rock above the Falls, which enabled
Perry to complete his fleet on Lake Erie.</p>

<p>On Lake Ontario, May 31, Chauncey insisted, not
without cause, on returning to Sackett’s Harbor.
Dearborn, instead of moving with his whole force,
ordered Brigadier-General Winder, June 1, to pursue
Vincent. Winder, with eight hundred or a thousand
men marched twenty miles, and then sent for
reinforcements. He was joined, June 5, by General
Chandler with another brigade. Chandler then took
command, and advanced with a force supposed to
number in the aggregate two thousand men<a id="FNanchor_177" href="#Footnote_177" class="fnanchor">177</a> to
Stony Creek, within ten miles of Vincent’s position
at Hamilton, where sixteen hundred British regulars
were encamped. There Chandler and Winder
posted themselves for the night, much as Winchester
and his Kentuckians had camped at the river Raisin
four months earlier.<a id="FNanchor_178" href="#Footnote_178" class="fnanchor">178</a></p>

<p>Vincent was not to be treated with such freedom.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>
Taking only seven hundred rank-and-file,<a id="FNanchor_179" href="#Footnote_179" class="fnanchor">179</a> he led
them himself against Chandler’s camp. The attack
began, in intense darkness, at two o’clock in the
morning of June 6. The British quickly broke the
American centre and carried the guns. The lines
became mixed, and extreme confusion lasted till
dawn. In the darkness both American generals,
Chandler and Winder, walked into the British force
in the centre, and were captured.<a id="FNanchor_180" href="#Footnote_180" class="fnanchor">180</a> With difficulty
the two armies succeeded in recovering their order,
and then retired in opposite directions. The British
suffered severely, reporting twenty-three killed, one
hundred and thirty-four wounded, and fifty-five missing,
or two hundred and twelve men in all; but they
safely regained Burlington Heights at dawn.<a id="FNanchor_181" href="#Footnote_181" class="fnanchor">181</a> The
American loss was less in casualties, for it amounted
only to fifty-five killed and wounded, and one hundred
missing; but in results the battle at Stony Creek
was equally disgraceful and decisive. The whole
American force, leaving the dead unburied, fell back
ten miles, where Major-General Lewis took command
in the afternoon of June 7. An hour later the British
fleet under Sir James Yeo made its appearance,
threatening to cut off Lewis’s retreat. Indians hovered
about. Boats and baggage were lost. Dearborn<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span>
sent pressing orders to Lewis directing him to return,
and on the morning of June 8 the division
reached Fort George.<a id="FNanchor_182" href="#Footnote_182" class="fnanchor">182</a></p>

<p>These mortifications prostrated Dearborn, whose
strength had been steadily failing. June 8 he wrote
to Armstrong: “My ill state of health renders it
extremely painful to attend to the current duties;
and unless my health improves soon, I fear I shall be
compelled to retire to some place where my mind
may be more at ease for a short time.”<a id="FNanchor_183" href="#Footnote_183" class="fnanchor">183</a> June 10,
his adjutant-general, Winfield Scott, issued orders devolving
on Major-General Morgan Lewis the temporary
command not only of the Niagara army but also
of the Ninth Military district.<a id="FNanchor_184" href="#Footnote_184" class="fnanchor">184</a> “In addition to the
debility and fever he has been afflicted with,” wrote
Dearborn’s aid, S.&nbsp;S. Connor, to Secretary Armstrong,
June 12,<a id="FNanchor_185" href="#Footnote_185" class="fnanchor">185</a> “he has, within the last twenty-four hours,
experienced a violent spasmodic attack on his breast,
which has obliged him to relinquish business altogether.”
“I have doubts whether he will ever again
be fit for service,” wrote Morgan Lewis to Armstrong,
June 14;<a id="FNanchor_186" href="#Footnote_186" class="fnanchor">186</a> “he has been repeatedly in a state of
convalescence, but relapses on the least agitation of
mind.” June 20 Dearborn himself wrote in a very
despondent spirit both in regard to his health and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span>
to the military situation: “I have been so reduced
in strength as to be incapable of any command.
Brigadier-General Boyd is the only general officer
present.”<a id="FNanchor_187" href="#Footnote_187" class="fnanchor">187</a></p>

<p>The sudden departure of Morgan Lewis, ordered
to Sackett’s Harbor, left General Boyd for a few days
to act as the general in command at Niagara. Boyd,
though well known for his success at Tippecanoe, was
not a favorite in the army. “A compound of ignorance,
vanity, and petulance,” wrote his late superior,
Morgan Lewis,<a id="FNanchor_188" href="#Footnote_188" class="fnanchor">188</a> “with nothing to recommend him but
that species of bravery in the field which is vaporing,
boisterous, stifling reflection, blinding observation, and
better adapted to the bully than the soldier.”</p>

<p>Galled by complaints of the imbecility of the army,
Boyd, with Dearborn’s approval,<a id="FNanchor_189" href="#Footnote_189" class="fnanchor">189</a> June 23, detached
Colonel Boerstler of the Fourteenth Infantry with
some four hundred men and two field-pieces, to batter
a stone house at Beaver Dam, some seventeen
miles from Fort George.<a id="FNanchor_190" href="#Footnote_190" class="fnanchor">190</a> Early in the morning of
June 24 Boerstler marched to Beaver Dam. There
he found himself surrounded in the woods by hostile
Indians, numbering according to British authority
about two hundred. The Indians, annoying both
front and rear, caused Boerstler to attempt retreat,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span>
but his retreat was stopped by a few militia-men,
said to number fifteen.<a id="FNanchor_191" href="#Footnote_191" class="fnanchor">191</a> A small detachment of one
hundred and fifty men came to reinforce Boerstler,
and Lieutenant Fitzgibbon of the British Forty-ninth
regiment, with forty-seven men, reinforced the Indians.
Unable to extricate himself, and dreading
dispersion and massacre, Boerstler decided to surrender;
and his five hundred and forty men accordingly
capitulated to a British lieutenant with two
hundred and sixty Indians, militia, and regulars.</p>

<p>Dearborn reported the disaster as “an unfortunate
and unaccountable event;”<a id="FNanchor_192" href="#Footnote_192" class="fnanchor">192</a> but of such events the
list seemed endless. A worse disaster, equally due
to Dearborn and Chauncey, occurred at the other end
of the Lake. Had they attacked Kingston, as Armstrong
intended, their movement would have covered
Sackett’s Harbor; but when they placed themselves
a hundred and fifty miles to the westward of Sackett’s
Harbor, they could do nothing to protect it.
Sackett’s Harbor was an easy morning’s sail from
Kingston, and the capture of the American naval
station was an object of infinite desire on the part of
Sir George Prevost, since it would probably decide
the result of the war.</p>

<p>Prevost, though not remarkable for audacity, could
not throw away such an opportunity without ruining
his reputation. He came to Kingston, and while<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span>
Dearborn was preparing to capture Fort George in
the night of May 26–27, Prevost embarked his whole
regular force, eight hundred men all told,<a id="FNanchor_193" href="#Footnote_193" class="fnanchor">193</a> on Yeo’s
fleet at Kingston, set sail in the night, and at dawn
of May 27 was in sight of Sackett’s Harbor.<a id="FNanchor_194" href="#Footnote_194" class="fnanchor">194</a></p>

<p>Had Yeo and Prevost acted with energy, they must
have captured the Harbor without serious resistance.
According to Sir George’s official report, “light and
adverse winds” prevented the ships from nearing the
Fort until evening.<a id="FNanchor_195" href="#Footnote_195" class="fnanchor">195</a> Probably constitutional vacillation
on the part of Sir James Yeo caused delay, for
Prevost left the control wholly to him and Colonel
Baynes.<a id="FNanchor_196" href="#Footnote_196" class="fnanchor">196</a></p>

<p>At Sackett’s Harbor about four hundred men of
different regular regiments, and about two hundred
and fifty Albany volunteers were in garrison; and
a general alarm, given on appearance of the British
fleet in the distance, brought some hundreds of
militia into the place; but the most important reinforcement
was Jacob Brown, a brigadier-general of
State militia who lived in the neighborhood, and
had been requested by Dearborn to take command
in case of an emergency. Brown arrived at the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span>
Harbor in time to post the men in order of battle.
Five hundred militia were placed at the point
where the British were expected to land; the regulars
were arranged in a second line; the forts were
in the rear.</p>

<p>At dawn of May 28, under command of Colonel
Baynes, the British grenadiers of the One Hundredth
regiment landed gallantly under “so heavy and galling
a fire from a numerous but almost invisible foe,
as to render it impossible to halt for the artillery to
come up.”<a id="FNanchor_197" href="#Footnote_197" class="fnanchor">197</a> Pressing rapidly forward, without stopping
to fire, the British regulars routed the militia
and forced the second line back until they reached a
block-house at the edge of the village, where a thirty-two
pound gun was in position, flanked by log barracks
and fallen timber. While Brown with difficulty
held his own at the military barracks, the naval
lieutenant in charge of the ship-yard, being told that
the battle was lost, set fire to the naval barracks,
shipping, and store-houses. Brown’s indignation at
this act was intense.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The burning of the marine barracks was as infamous
a transaction as ever occurred among military men,” he
wrote to Dearborn.<a id="FNanchor_198" href="#Footnote_198" class="fnanchor">198</a> “The fire was set as our regulars
met the enemy upon the main line; and if anything could
have appalled these gallant men it would have been the
flames in their rear. We have all, I presume, suffered in
the public estimation in consequence of this disgraceful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
burning. The fact is, however, that the army is entitled
to much higher praise than though it had not occurred.
The navy are alone responsible for what happened on
Navy Point, and it is fortunate for them that they have
reputations sufficient to sustain the shock.”</p>
</div>

<p>Brown’s second line stood firm at the barracks,
and the British attack found advance impossible.
Sir George Prevost’s report admitted his inability to
go <span class="locked">farther:<a id="FNanchor_199" href="#Footnote_199" class="fnanchor">199</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“A heavier fire than that of musketry having become
necessary in order to force their last position, I had the
mortification to learn that the continuation of light and
adverse winds had prevented the co-operation of the
ships, and that the gunboats were unequal to silence the
enemy’s elevated batteries, or to produce any effect on
their block houses. Considering it therefore impracticable
without such assistance to carry the strong works by
which the post was defended, I reluctantly ordered the
troops to leave a beaten enemy whom they had driven
before them for upwards of three hours, and who did not
venture to offer the slightest opposition to the re-embarkation,
which was effected with proper deliberation and
in perfect order.”</p>
</div>

<p>If Sir George was correct in regarding the Americans
as “a beaten enemy,” his order of retreat to
his own troops seemed improper; but his language
showed that he used the words in a sense of his
own, and Colonel Baynes’s report gave no warrant
for the British claim of a victory.<a id="FNanchor_200" href="#Footnote_200" class="fnanchor">200</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At this point,” said Baynes,<a id="FNanchor_201" href="#Footnote_201" class="fnanchor">201</a> “the further energies
of the troops became unavailing. Their [American]
block-houses and stockaded battery could not be carried
by assault, nor reduced by field-pieces had we been provided
with them.... Seeing no object within our reach
to attain that could compensate for the loss we were momentarily
sustaining from the heavy fire of the enemy’s
cannon, I directed the troops to take up the position we
had charged from. From this position we were ordered
to re-embark, which was performed at our leisure and in
perfect order, the enemy not presuming to show a single
soldier without the limits of his fortress.”</p>
</div>

<p>Another and confidential report was written by
E.&nbsp;B. Brenton of Prevost’s staff to the governor’s
military secretary, Noah Freer.<a id="FNanchor_202" href="#Footnote_202" class="fnanchor">202</a> After describing
the progress of the battle until the British advance
was stopped, Brenton said that Colonel Baynes came
to Sir George to tell him that the men could not
approach nearer the works with any prospect of
<span class="locked">success:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was however determined to collect all the troops
at a point, to form the line, and to make an attack immediately
upon the battery and barracks in front. For
this purpose the men in advance were called in, the line
formed a little without the reach of the enemy’s musketry,
and though evidently much fagged, was, after being
supplied with fresh ammunition, again led in line.
At this time I do not think the whole force collected in
the lines exceeded five hundred men.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_168">168</span></p>

<p>The attack was made, and part of the Hundred-and-fourth
regiment succeeded in getting shelter behind
one of the American barracks, preparing for a
farther advance. Sir George Prevost, under a fire
which his aid described as tremendous,—“I do
not exaggerate when I tell you that the shot, both
of musketry and grape, was falling about us like
hail,”—watched the American position through a
glass, when, “at this time those who were left of
the troops behind the barracks made a dash out to
charge the enemy; but the fire was so destructive
that they were instantly turned by it, and the retreat
was sounded. Sir George, fearless of danger
and disdaining to run or to suffer his men to run,
repeatedly called out to them to retire in order;
many however made off as fast as they could.”</p>

<p>These reports agreed that the British attack was
totally defeated, with severe loss, before the retreat
was sounded. Such authorities should have silenced
dispute; but Prevost had many enemies in Canada,
and at that period of the war the British troops
were unused to defeat. Both Canadians and English
attacked the governor-general privately and publicly,
freely charging him with having disgraced the
service, and offering evidence of his want of courage
in the action.<a id="FNanchor_203" href="#Footnote_203" class="fnanchor">203</a> Americans, though not interested
in the defence of Prevost, could not fail to remark
that the British and Canadian authorities who condemned
him, assumed a condition of affairs altogether<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span>
different from that accepted by American
authorities. The official American reports not only
supported the views taken by Prevost and Baynes
of the hopelessness of the British attack, but added
particulars which made Prevost’s retreat necessary.
General Brown’s opinion was emphatic: “Had not
General Prevost retired <em>most rapidly</em> under the guns
of his vessels, he would never have returned to
Kingston.”<a id="FNanchor_204" href="#Footnote_204" class="fnanchor">204</a> These words were a part of Brown’s
official report. Writing to Dearborn he spoke with
the same <span class="locked">confidence:<a id="FNanchor_205" href="#Footnote_205" class="fnanchor">205</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The militia were all rallied before the enemy gave
way, and were marching perfectly in his view towards
the rear of his right flank; and I am confident that even
then, if Sir George had not retired with the utmost precipitation
to his boats, he would have been cut off.”</p>
</div>

<p>Unlike the Canadians, Brown thought Prevost’s
conduct correct and necessary, but was by no means
equally complimentary to Sir James Yeo, whom he
blamed greatly for failing to join in the battle. The
want of wind which Yeo alleged in excuse, Brown
flatly denied. From that time Brown entertained
and freely expressed contempt for Yeo, as he seemed
also to feel little respect for Chauncey. His experience
with naval administration on both sides led
him to expect nothing but inefficiency from either.</p>

<p>Whatever were the true causes of Prevost’s failure,
Americans could not admit that an expedition which<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span>
cost the United States so much, and which so nearly
succeeded, was discreditable to the British governor-general,
or was abandoned without sufficient reason.
The British return of killed and wounded proved the
correctness of Prevost, Baynes, and Brown in their
opinion of the necessity of retreat. According to
the report of Prevost’s severest critics, he carried
less than seven hundred and fifty rank-and-file to
Sackett’s Harbor.<a id="FNanchor_206" href="#Footnote_206" class="fnanchor">206</a> The returns showed forty-four
rank-and-file killed; one hundred and seventy-two
wounded, and thirteen missing,—in all, two hundred
and twenty-nine men, or nearly one man in three.
The loss in officers was relatively even more severe;
and the total loss in an aggregate which could hardly
have numbered much more than eight hundred and
fifty men all told, amounted to two hundred and fifty-nine
killed, wounded, and missing, leaving Prevost
less than six hundred men to escape,<a id="FNanchor_207" href="#Footnote_207" class="fnanchor">207</a> in the face
of twice their numbers and under the fire of heavy
guns.<a id="FNanchor_208" href="#Footnote_208" class="fnanchor">208</a></p>

<p>The British attack was repulsed, and Jacob Brown
received much credit as well as a commission of brigadier-general
in the United States army for his success;
but the injury inflicted by the premature destruction
at the navy-yard was very great, and was
sensibly felt. Such a succession of ill news could
not but affect the Government. The repeated failures
to destroy the British force at Niagara; the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span>
disasters of Chandler, Winder, and Boerstler; the
narrow and partial escape of Sackett’s Harbor; the total
incapacity of Dearborn caused by fever and mortification,—all
these evils were not the only or the
greatest subjects for complaint. The two commanders,
Dearborn and Chauncey, had set aside the secretary’s
plan of campaign, and had substituted one
of their own, on the express ground of their superior
information. While affirming that the garrison
at Kingston had been reinforced to a strength three
or four times as great as was humanly possible, they
had asserted that the capture of York would answer
their purpose as well as the capture of Kingston, to
“give us the complete command of the Lake.” They
captured York, April 27, but the British fleet appeared
June 6, and took from them the command of
the Lake. These miscalculations or misstatements,
and the disasters resulting from them, warranted the
removal of Chauncey as well as Dearborn from command;
but the brunt of dissatisfaction fell on Dearborn
alone. Both Cabinet and Congress agreed in
insisting on Dearborn’s retirement, and the President
was obliged to consent. July 6, Secretary Armstrong
<span class="locked">wrote,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the President’s orders to express to you the
decision that you retire from the command of District
No. 9, and of the troops within the same, until your
health be re-established and until further orders.”</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Armstrong’s</span> embarrassment was great in getting
rid of the generals whom Madison and Eustis left on
his hands. Dearborn was one example of what he
was obliged to endure, but Wilkinson was a worse.
According to Armstrong’s account,<a id="FNanchor_209" href="#Footnote_209" class="fnanchor">209</a> New Orleans was
not believed to be safe in Wilkinson’s keeping. The
senators from Louisiana, Tennessee, and Kentucky
remonstrated to the President, and the President
ordered his removal. Armstrong and Wilkinson had
been companions in arms, and had served with Gates
at Saratoga. For many reasons Armstrong wished
not unnecessarily to mortify Wilkinson, and in conveying
to him, March 10, the abrupt order<a id="FNanchor_210" href="#Footnote_210" class="fnanchor">210</a> to proceed
with the least possible delay to the headquarters of
Major-General Dearborn at Sackett’s Harbor, the
Secretary of War added, March 12, a friendly letter
of <span class="locked">advice:<a id="FNanchor_211" href="#Footnote_211" class="fnanchor">211</a>—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span></p>

<p>“Why should you remain in your land of cypress when
patriotism and ambition equally invite to one where grows
the laurel? Again, the men of the North and East want
you; those of the South and West are less sensible of
your merits and less anxious to have you among them.
I speak to you with a frankness due to you and to myself,
and again advise, Come to the North, and come
quickly! If our cards be well played, we may renew the
scene of Saratoga.”</p>
</div>

<p>The phrase was curious. Saratoga suggested defeated
invasion rather than conquest; the surrender
of a British army in the heart of New York rather
than the capture of Montreal. The request for Wilkinson’s
aid was disheartening. No one knew better
than Armstrong the feebleness of Wilkinson’s true
character. “The selection of this unprincipled imbecile
was not the blunder of Secretary Armstrong,”
said Winfield Scott long afterward;<a id="FNanchor_212" href="#Footnote_212" class="fnanchor">212</a> but the idea
that Wilkinson could be chief-of-staff to Dearborn,—that
one weak man could give strength to another,—was
almost as surprising as the selection of Wilkinson
to chief command would have been. Armstrong
did not intend that Wilkinson should command
more than a division under Dearborn;<a id="FNanchor_213" href="#Footnote_213" class="fnanchor">213</a> but he must
have foreseen that in the event of Dearborn’s illness
or incapacity, Wilkinson would become by seniority
general-in-chief.</p>

<p>Wilkinson at New Orleans received Armstrong’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span>
letter of March 10 only May 19,<a id="FNanchor_214" href="#Footnote_214" class="fnanchor">214</a> and started, June 10,
for Washington, where he arrived July 31, having
consumed the greater part of the summer in the
journey. On arriving at Washington, he found that
Dearborn had been removed, and that he was himself
by seniority in command of the Ninth Military District.<a id="FNanchor_215" href="#Footnote_215" class="fnanchor">215</a>
This result of Dearborn’s removal was incalculably
mischievous, for if its effect on Wilkinson’s
vanity was unfortunate, its influence on the army was
fatal. Almost every respectable officer of the old service
regarded Wilkinson with antipathy or contempt.</p>

<p>Armstrong’s ill-fortune obliged him also to place
in the position of next importance Wilkinson’s pronounced
enemy, Wade Hampton. A major-general
was required to take command on Lake Champlain,
and but one officer of that rank claimed employment
or could be employed; and Wade Hampton was accordingly
ordered to Plattsburg.<a id="FNanchor_216" href="#Footnote_216" class="fnanchor">216</a> Of all the major-generals
Hampton was probably the best; but his
faults were serious. Proud and sensitive even for a
South Carolinian; irritable, often harsh, sometimes
unjust, but the soul of honor,<a id="FNanchor_217" href="#Footnote_217" class="fnanchor">217</a> Hampton was rendered
wholly intractable wherever Wilkinson was concerned,
by the long-standing feud which had made
the two generals for years the heads of hostile sections<span class="pagenum" id="Page_175">175</span>
in the army.<a id="FNanchor_218" href="#Footnote_218" class="fnanchor">218</a> Hampton loathed Wilkinson. At
the time of his appointment to command on Lake
Champlain he had no reason to expect that Wilkinson
would be his superior; but though willing and
even wishing to serve under Dearborn, he accepted
only on the express understanding that his was a
distinct and separate command,<a id="FNanchor_219" href="#Footnote_219" class="fnanchor">219</a> and that his orders
were to come directly from the War Department.
Only in case of a combined movement uniting different
armies, was he to yield to the rule of seniority.
With that agreement he left Washington, June 15,
and assumed command, July 3, on Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>Nearly a month afterward Wilkinson arrived in
Washington, and reported at the War Department.
By that time Armstrong had lost whatever chance
he previously possessed of drawing the army at Niagara
back to a position on the enemy’s line of supply.
Three insuperable difficulties stood in his way,—the
season was too late; the army was too weak; and
the generals were incompetent. Armstrong found
his generals the chief immediate obstacle, and struggled
perseveringly and good-humoredly to overcome
it. Wilkinson began, on arriving at Washington,
by showing a fancy for continuing the campaign at
Niagara.<a id="FNanchor_220" href="#Footnote_220" class="fnanchor">220</a> Armstrong was obliged to give an emphatic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span>
order, dated August 8, that Kingston should
be the primary object of the campaign, but he left
Wilkinson at liberty to go there by almost any route,
even by way of Montreal.<a id="FNanchor_221" href="#Footnote_221" class="fnanchor">221</a> Disappointed at the outset
by finding Wilkinson slow to accept responsibility
or decided views,<a id="FNanchor_222" href="#Footnote_222" class="fnanchor">222</a> he was not better pleased when the
new general began his duties in Military District No. 9.</p>

<p>Wilkinson left Washington August 11, and no
sooner did he reach Albany than he hastened to
write, August 16, two letters to General Hampton,
assuming that every movement of that general was
directly dependent on Wilkinson’s orders.<a id="FNanchor_223" href="#Footnote_223" class="fnanchor">223</a> Considering
the relations between the two men, these
letters warranted the inference that Wilkinson intended
to drive Hampton out of his Military District,
and if possible from the service. Hampton
instantly leaped to that conclusion, and wrote to
Armstrong, August 23, offering his resignation in
case Wilkinson’s course was authorized by government.<a id="FNanchor_224" href="#Footnote_224" class="fnanchor">224</a>
Wilkinson also wrote to the secretary August
30, substantially avowing his object to be what
Hampton <span class="locked">supposed:<a id="FNanchor_225" href="#Footnote_225" class="fnanchor">225</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You have copies of my letters to Major-General
Hampton, which I know he has received, yet I have no<span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span>
answer. The reflection which naturally occurs is that
if I am authorized to command he is bound to obey;
and if he will not respect the obligation, he should be
turned out of the service.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong pacified Hampton by promising once
more that all his orders and reports should pass
through the Department. Hampton promised to serve
cordially and vigorously through the campaign, but
he believed himself intended for a sacrifice, and declared
his intention of resigning as soon as the
campaign was ended.<a id="FNanchor_226" href="#Footnote_226" class="fnanchor">226</a> Wilkinson, after having at
Albany provoked this outburst, started for Sackett’s
Harbor, where he arrived August 20.</p>

<p>At Sackett’s Harbor Wilkinson found several general
officers. Morgan Lewis was there in command,
Commodore Chauncey was there with his fleet. Jacob
Brown was also present by virtue of his recent appointment
as brigadier-general. The quartermaster-general,
Robert Swartwout, a brother of Burr’s friend
who went to New Orleans, was posted there. Wilkinson
summoned these officers to a council of
war August 26, which deliberated on the different
plans of campaign proposed to it, and unanimously
decided in favor of one called by Armstrong
“No. 3 of the plans proposed by the government.”<a id="FNanchor_227" href="#Footnote_227" class="fnanchor">227</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
As defined in Wilkinson’s language<a id="FNanchor_228" href="#Footnote_228" class="fnanchor">228</a> the scheme
<span class="locked">was—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“To rendezvous the whole of the troops on the Lake in
this vicinity, and in co-operation with our squadron to
make a bold feint upon Kingston, slip down the St.
Lawrence, lock up the enemy in our rear to starve or
surrender, or oblige him to follow us without artillery,
baggage, or provisions, or eventually to lay down his
arms; to sweep the St. Lawrence of armed craft, and in
concert with the division under Major-General Hampton
to take Montreal.”</p>
</div>

<p>Orders were given, August 25, for providing river
transport for seven thousand men, forty field-pieces,
and twenty heavy guns, to be in readiness by
September 15.<a id="FNanchor_229" href="#Footnote_229" class="fnanchor">229</a></p>

<p>The proposed expedition closely imitated General
Amherst’s expedition against Montreal in 1760, with
serious differences of relative situation. After Wolfe
had captured Quebec and hardly twenty-five hundred
French troops remained to defend Montreal, in the
month of July Amherst descended the river from
Lake Ontario with more than ten thousand men,
chiefly British veterans, capturing every fortified position
as he went. Wilkinson’s council of war proposed
to descend the river in October or November
with seven thousand men, leaving a hostile fleet and
fortresses in their rear, and running past every fortified<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span>
position to arrive in the heart of a comparatively
well populated country, held by a force greater
than their own, with Quebec to support it, while
Wilkinson would have no certain base of supplies,
reinforcements, or path of escape. Knowledge of
Wilkinson’s favorite Quintus Curtius or of Armstrong’s
familiar Jomini was not required to satisfy
any intelligent private, however newly recruited, that
under such circumstances the army would be fortunate
to escape destruction.<a id="FNanchor_230" href="#Footnote_230" class="fnanchor">230</a></p>

<p>Wilkinson next went to Niagara, where he arrived
September 4, and where he found the army in a bad
condition, with Boyd still in command, but restrained
by the President’s orders within a strict defensive.
Wilkinson remained nearly a month at Fort George
making the necessary preparations for a movement.
He fell ill of fever, but returned October 2 to Sackett’s
Harbor, taking with him all the regular troops
at Niagara. At that time Chauncey again controlled
the Lake.</p>

<p>Secretary Armstrong also came to Sackett’s Harbor,
September 5, and established the War Department
at that remote point for nearly two months.<a id="FNanchor_231" href="#Footnote_231" class="fnanchor">231</a>
When Wilkinson arrived, October 2, Armstrong’s
difficulties began. Wilkinson, then fifty-six years
old, was broken by the Lake fever. “He was so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span>
much indisposed in mind and body,” according to
Brigadier-General Boyd,<a id="FNanchor_232" href="#Footnote_232" class="fnanchor">232</a> “that in any other service
he would have perhaps been superseded in his command.”
According to Wilkinson’s story, he told
Secretary Armstrong that he was incapable of commanding
the army, and offered to retire from it;
but the secretary said there was no one to take his
place, and he could not be spared. In private
Armstrong was believed to express himself more
bluntly, and Wilkinson was told that the secretary
said: “I would feed the old man with pap
sooner than leave him behind.”<a id="FNanchor_233" href="#Footnote_233" class="fnanchor">233</a> Wilkinson’s debility
did not prevent him from giving orders, or
from becoming jealous and suspicious of every one,
but chiefly of Armstrong.<a id="FNanchor_234" href="#Footnote_234" class="fnanchor">234</a> Whatever was suggested
by Armstrong was opposed by Wilkinson.
Before returning to Sackett’s Harbor, October 4,
Wilkinson favored an attack on Kingston.<a id="FNanchor_235" href="#Footnote_235" class="fnanchor">235</a> On
reaching Sackett’s Harbor, finding that Armstrong
also favored attacking Kingston, Wilkinson argued
“against my own judgment” in favor of passing
Kingston and descending upon Montreal.<a id="FNanchor_236" href="#Footnote_236" class="fnanchor">236</a> Ten days
afterward Armstrong changed his mind. Yeo had
succeeded in returning to Kingston, bringing reinforcements.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He will bring with him about fifteen hundred effectives,”
wrote Armstrong;<a id="FNanchor_237" href="#Footnote_237" class="fnanchor">237</a> “and thanks to the storm
and our snail-like movements down the Lake, they will
be there before we can reach it. The manœuvre intended
is lost, so far as regards Kingston. What we
now do against that place must be done by hard blows,
at some risk.”</p>
</div>

<p>Accordingly, October 19, Armstrong wrote to
Wilkinson a letter advising abandonment of the
attack on Kingston, and an effort at “grasping the
safer and the greater object below.”<a id="FNanchor_238" href="#Footnote_238" class="fnanchor">238</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I call it the safer and greater object, because at
Montreal you find the weaker place and the smaller force
to encounter; at Montreal you meet a fresh, unexhausted,
efficient reinforcement of four thousand men; at Montreal
you approach your own resources, and establish
between you and them an easy and an expeditious
intercourse; at Montreal you occupy a point which
must be gained in carrying your attacks home to the
purposes of the war, and which, if seized now, will save
one campaign; at Montreal you hold a position which
completely severs the enemy’s line of operations, which
shuts up the Ottawa as well as the St. Lawrence against
him, and which while it restrains all below, withers and
perishes all above itself.”</p>
</div>

<p>As Armstrong veered toward Montreal Wilkinson
turned decidedly toward Kingston, and wrote the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_182">182</span>
same day to the secretary a letter<a id="FNanchor_239" href="#Footnote_239" class="fnanchor">239</a> of remonstrance,
closing by a significant <span class="locked">remark:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Personal considerations would make me prefer a
visit to Montreal to the attack of Kingston; but before
I abandon this attack, which by my instructions I am
ordered to make, it is necessary to my justification that
you should by the authority of the President direct the
operations of the army under my command particularly
against Montreal.”</p>
</div>

<p>The hint was strong that Wilkinson believed
Armstrong to be trying to evade responsibility, as
Armstrong believed Wilkinson to be trying to shirk
it. Both insinuations were probably well-founded;
neither Armstrong nor Wilkinson expected to capture
Kingston, and still less Montreal. Wilkinson
plainly said as much at the time. “I speak conjecturally,”
he wrote; “but should we surmount
every obstacle in descending the river we shall
advance upon Montreal ignorant of the force arrayed
against us, and in case of misfortune, having
no retreat, the army must surrender at discretion.”
Armstrong’s conduct was more extraordinary
than Wilkinson’s, and could not be believed
except on his own evidence. He not only looked
for no capture of Montreal, but before writing his
letter of October 19 to Wilkinson, he had given
orders for preparing winter quarters for the army
sixty or eighty miles above Montreal, and did this<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span>
without informing Wilkinson. In later years he
<span class="locked">wrote:<a id="FNanchor_240" href="#Footnote_240" class="fnanchor">240</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Suspecting early in October, from the lateness of the
season, the inclemency of the weather, and the continued
indisposition of the commanding general, that the campaign
then in progress would terminate as it did,—‘with
the disgrace of doing nothing, but without any material
diminution of physical power,’—the Secretary of War,
then at Sackett’s Harbor, hastened to direct Major-General
Hampton to employ a brigade of militia attached
to his command, in constructing as many huts
as would be sufficient to cover an army of ten thousand
men during the winter.”</p>
</div>

<p>The order dated October 16 and addressed to the
quartermaster-general,<a id="FNanchor_241" href="#Footnote_241" class="fnanchor">241</a> prescribed the cantonment
of ten thousand men within the limits of Canada,
and plainly indicated the secretary’s expectation
that the army could not reach Montreal. In other
ways Armstrong showed the same belief more
openly.</p>

<p>All the available troops on or near Lake Ontario
were concentrated at Sackett’s Harbor about the
middle of October, and did not exceed seven thousand
effectives, or eight thousand men.<a id="FNanchor_242" href="#Footnote_242" class="fnanchor">242</a> “I calculate
on six thousand combatants,” wrote Wilkinson after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
starting,<a id="FNanchor_243" href="#Footnote_243" class="fnanchor">243</a> “exclusive of Scott and Randolph, neither
of whom will, I fear, be up in season.” The army
was divided into four brigades under Generals Boyd,
Swartwout, Jacob Brown, and Covington,—the latter
a Maryland man, forty-five years old, who entered
the service in 1809 as lieutenant-colonel of dragoons.
The brigades of Boyd and Covington formed a division
commanded by Major-General Morgan Lewis.
The second division was intended for Major-General
Hampton; a reserve under Colonel Macomb, and
a park of artillery under Brigadier-General Moses
Porter, completed the organization.<a id="FNanchor_244" href="#Footnote_244" class="fnanchor">244</a></p>

<p>The men were embarked in bateaux, October 17,
at Henderson’s Bay, to the westward of Sackett’s
Harbor. The weather had been excessively stormy,
and continued so. The first resting-point to be
reached was Grenadier Island at the entrance of the
St. Lawrence, only sixteen or eighteen miles from
the starting-point; but the bateaux were dispersed
by heavy gales of wind, October 18, 19, and 20, and
the last detachments did not reach Grenadier Island
until November 3. “All our hopes have been nearly
blasted,” wrote Wilkinson October 24; but at length,
November 5, the expedition, numbering nearly three
hundred boats, having safely entered the river, began
the descent from French Creek. That day they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
moved forty miles, and halted about midnight six
miles above Ogdensburg. The next day was consumed
in running the flotilla past Ogdensburg under
the fire of the British guns at Prescott. The boats
floated down by night and the troops marched by
land. November 7 the army halted at the White
House, about twenty miles below Ogdensburg. There
Wilkinson called a council of war, November 8, to
consider whether the expedition should proceed.
Lewis, Boyd, Brown, and Swartwout voted simply in
favor of attacking Montreal. Covington and Porter
were of the opinion “that we proceed from this place
under great danger, ... but ... we know of no other
alternative.”<a id="FNanchor_245" href="#Footnote_245" class="fnanchor">245</a></p>

<p>More than any other cause, Armstrong’s conduct
warranted Wilkinson in considering the campaign
at an end. If the attack on Montreal was seriously
intended, every motive required Armstrong to join
Hampton at once in advance of Wilkinson’s expedition.
No one knew so well as he the necessity
of some authority to interpose between the tempers
and pretensions of these two men in case a joint
campaign were to be attempted, or to enforce co-operation
on either side. Good faith toward Hampton,
even more than toward Wilkinson, required that the
secretary who had led them into such a situation
should not desert them. Yet Armstrong, after waiting
till Wilkinson was fairly at Grenadier Island,
began to prepare for return to Washington. From<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span>
the village of Antwerp, half way between Sackett’s
Harbor and Ogdensburg, the secretary wrote to Wilkinson,
October 27, “Should my fever continue I
shall not be able to approach you as I intended.”<a id="FNanchor_246" href="#Footnote_246" class="fnanchor">246</a>
Three days later he wrote again from Denmark on
the road to <span class="locked">Albany,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I rejoice that your difficulties are so far surmounted
as to enable you to say with assurance when you will
pass Prescott. I should have met you there; but bad
roads, worse weather, and a considerable degree of illness
admonished me against receding farther from a point
where my engagements call me about the 1st proximo.
The resolution of treading back my steps was taken at
Antwerp.”<a id="FNanchor_247" href="#Footnote_247" class="fnanchor">247</a></p>
</div>

<p>From Albany Armstrong wrote, November 12, for
the last time, “in the fulness of my faith that you
are in Montreal,”<a id="FNanchor_248" href="#Footnote_248" class="fnanchor">248</a> that he had sent orders to Hampton
to effect a junction with the river expedition.
Such letters and orders, whatever Armstrong meant
by them, were certain to impress both Wilkinson
and Hampton with a conviction that the secretary
intended to throw upon them the whole responsibility
for the failure of an expedition which he as
well as they knew to be hopeless.</p>

<p>Doubtless a vigorous general might still have found<span class="pagenum" id="Page_187">187</span>
means if not to take Montreal, at least to compel the
British to evacuate Upper Canada; but Wilkinson
was naturally a weak man, and during the descent
of the river he was excessively ill, never able to
make a great exertion. Every day his difficulties
increased. Hardly had his flotilla begun its descent,
when a number of British gunboats commanded by
Captain Mulcaster, the most energetic officer in the
British naval service on the Lake, slipping through
Chauncey’s blockade, appeared in Wilkinson’s rear,
and caused him much annoyance. Eight hundred
British rank-and-file from Kingston and Prescott
were with Mulcaster, and at every narrow pass of
the river, musketry and artillery began to open on
Wilkinson from the British bank. Progress became
slow. November 7, Macomb was landed on the north
bank with twelve hundred men to clear away these
obstructions.<a id="FNanchor_249" href="#Footnote_249" class="fnanchor">249</a> The day and night of November 8
were consumed at the White House in passing troops
across the river. Brown’s brigade was landed on
the north shore to reinforce Macomb. The boats
were delayed to keep pace with Brown’s march on
shore, and made but eleven miles November 9, and
the next day, November 10, fell down only to the
Long Saut, a continuous rapid eight miles in length.
The enemy pressed close, and while Brown marched
in advance to clear the bank along the rapid, Boyd
was ordered to take all the other troops and protect
the rear.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span></p>

<p>The flotilla stopped on the night of November 10
near a farm called Chrystler’s on the British bank;
and the next morning, November 11, at half-past ten
o’clock Brown having announced that all was clear
below, Wilkinson was about to order the flotilla to
run the rapids when General Boyd sent word that the
enemy in the rear were advancing in column. Wilkinson
was on his boat, unable to leave his bed;<a id="FNanchor_250" href="#Footnote_250" class="fnanchor">250</a>
Morgan Lewis was in no better condition; and Boyd
was left to fight a battle as he best could. Boyd never
had the confidence of the army; Brown was said
to have threatened to resign rather than serve under
him,<a id="FNanchor_251" href="#Footnote_251" class="fnanchor">251</a> and Winfield Scott, who was that day with Macomb
and Brown in the advance, described<a id="FNanchor_252" href="#Footnote_252" class="fnanchor">252</a> Boyd as
amiable and respectable in a subordinate position, but
“vacillating and imbecile beyond all endurance as a
chief under high responsibilities.”</p>

<p>The opportunity to capture or destroy Mulcaster
and his eight hundred men was brilliant, and warranted
Wilkinson in turning back his whole force
to accomplish it. Boyd actually employed three
brigades, and made an obstinate but not united or
well-supported attempt to crush the enemy. Colonel
Ripley with the Twenty-first regiment drove in the
British skirmishers, and at half-past two o’clock the
battle became general. At half-past four, after a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span>
stubborn engagement, General Covington was killed;
his brigade gave way, and the whole American line
fell back, beaten and almost routed.</p>

<p>This defeat was the least creditable of the disasters
suffered by American arms during the war.
No excuse or palliation was ever offered for it.<a id="FNanchor_253" href="#Footnote_253" class="fnanchor">253</a> The
American army consisted wholly of regulars, and all
the generals belonged to the regular service. Wilkinson
could hardly have had less than three thousand
men with him, after allowing for his detachments,
and was alone to blame if he had not more. Boyd,
according to his own account, had more than twelve
hundred men and two field-pieces under his immediate
command on shore.<a id="FNanchor_254" href="#Footnote_254" class="fnanchor">254</a> The reserve, under Colonel
Upham of the Eleventh regiment, contained six hundred
rank-and-file,<a id="FNanchor_255" href="#Footnote_255" class="fnanchor">255</a> with four field-pieces. Wilkinson’s
official report admitted that eighteen hundred
rank-and-file were engaged; Colonel Walbach, his adjutant-general,
admitted two thousand,<a id="FNanchor_256" href="#Footnote_256" class="fnanchor">256</a> while Swartwout
thought that twenty-one hundred were in action.
The American force was certainly not less than two
thousand, with six field-pieces.</p>

<p>The British force officially reported by Lieutenant-Colonel
Morrison of the Eighty-ninth regiment, who
was in command, consisted of eight hundred rank-and-file,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span>
and thirty Indians. The rank-and-file consisted
of three hundred and forty-two men of the
Forty-ninth regiment, about as many more of the
Eighty-ninth, and some Canadian troops. They had
three six-pound field-pieces, and were supported on
their right flank by gunboats.<a id="FNanchor_257" href="#Footnote_257" class="fnanchor">257</a></p>

<p>On the American side the battle was ill fought
both by the generals and by the men. Wilkinson
and Morgan Lewis, the two major-generals, who were
ill on their boats, never gave an order. Boyd, who
commanded, brought his troops into action by detachments,
and the men, on meeting unexpected
resistance, broke and fled. The defeat was bloody
as well as mortifying. Wilkinson reported one hundred
and two killed, and two hundred and thirty-seven
wounded, but strangely reported no missing,<a id="FNanchor_258" href="#Footnote_258" class="fnanchor">258</a>
although the British occupied the field of battle,
and claimed upward of one hundred prisoners.<a id="FNanchor_259" href="#Footnote_259" class="fnanchor">259</a>
Morrison reported twenty-two killed, one hundred
and forty-eight wounded, and twelve missing. The
American loss was twice that of the British, and
Wilkinson’s reports were so little to be trusted
that the loss might well have been greater than
he represented it. The story had no redeeming
incident.</p>

<p>If three brigades, numbering two thousand men,
were beaten at Chrystler’s farm by eight hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span>
British and Canadians, the chance that Wilkinson
could capture Montreal, even with ten thousand men,
was small. The conduct of the army showed its
want of self-confidence. Late as it was, in the dusk
of the evening Boyd hastened to escape across the
river. “The troops being much exhausted,” reported
Wilkinson,<a id="FNanchor_260" href="#Footnote_260" class="fnanchor">260</a> “it was considered most convenient that
they should embark, and that the dragoons with the
artillery should proceed by land. The embarkation
took place without the smallest molestation from the
enemy, and the flotilla made a harbor near the head
of the Saut on the opposite shore.” In truth, neither
Wilkinson nor his adjutant gave the order of embarkation,<a id="FNanchor_261" href="#Footnote_261" class="fnanchor">261</a>
nor was Boyd willing to admit it as his.<a id="FNanchor_262" href="#Footnote_262" class="fnanchor">262</a>
Apparently the army by common consent embarked
without orders.</p>

<p>Early the next morning, November 12, the flotilla
ran the rapids and rejoined Brown and Macomb near
Cornwall, where Wilkinson learned that General
Hampton had taken the responsibility of putting an
end to an undertaking which had not yet entered
upon its serious difficulties.</p>

<p>Four months had passed since Hampton took command
on Lake Champlain. When he first reached<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
Burlington, July 3, neither men nor material were
ready, nor was even a naval force present to cover
his weakness. While he was camped at Burlington,
a British fleet, with about a thousand regulars,
entered the Lake from the Isle aux Noix and the
Richelieu River, and plundered the American magazines
at Plattsburg, July 31, sweeping the Lake clear
of American shipping.<a id="FNanchor_263" href="#Footnote_263" class="fnanchor">263</a> Neither Hampton’s army
nor McDonough’s small fleet ventured to offer resistance.
Six weeks afterward, in the middle of September,
Hampton had but about four thousand men,
in bad condition and poor discipline.</p>

<p>Wilkinson, though unable to begin his own movement,
was earnest that Hampton should advance on
Montreal.<a id="FNanchor_264" href="#Footnote_264" class="fnanchor">264</a> Apparently in order to assist Wilkinson’s
plans, Hampton moved his force, September 19,
to the Canada line. Finding that a drought had
caused want of water on the direct road to Montreal,
Hampton decided to march his army westward to
the Chateaugay River, forty or fifty miles, and established
himself there, September 26, in a position
equally threatening to Montreal and to the British
line of communication up the St. Lawrence. Armstrong
approved the movement,<a id="FNanchor_265" href="#Footnote_265" class="fnanchor">265</a> and Hampton remained
three weeks at Chateaugay, building roads<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
and opening lines of communication while waiting
for Wilkinson to move.</p>

<p>October 16 Armstrong ordered Hampton, in view
of Wilkinson’s probable descent of the river, to “approach
the mouth of the Chateaugay, or other point
which shall better favor our junction, and hold the
enemy in check.”<a id="FNanchor_266" href="#Footnote_266" class="fnanchor">266</a> Hampton instantly obeyed, and
moved down the Chateaugay to a point about fifteen
miles from its mouth. There he established his
army, October 22, and employed the next two days
in completing his road, and getting up his artillery
and stores.</p>

<p>Hampton’s movements annoyed the British authorities
at Montreal. Even while he was still within
American territory, before he advanced from Chateaugay
Four Corners, Sir George Prevost reported,
October 8, to his <span class="locked">government,<a id="FNanchor_267" href="#Footnote_267" class="fnanchor">267</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The position of Major-General Hampton at the Four
Corners on the Chateaugay River, and which he continued
to occupy, either with the whole or a part of his
force, from the latest information I have been able to
obtain from thence, is highly judicious,—as at the
same time that he threatens Montreal and obliges me
to concentrate a considerable body of troops in this
vicinity to protect it, he has it in his power to molest
the communication with the Upper Province, and impede
the progress of the supplies required there for the Navy
and Army.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_194">194</span></p>

<p>If this was the case, October 8, when Hampton was
still at Chateaugay, fifty miles from its mouth, the
annoyance must have been much greater when he
advanced, October 21, to Spear’s, within ten miles of
the St. Lawrence on his left, and fifteen from the
mouth of the Chateaugay. Hampton accomplished
more than was expected. He held a position equally
well adapted to threaten Montreal, to disturb British
communication with Upper Canada, and to succor
Wilkinson.</p>

<p>That Hampton, with only four thousand men, should
do more than this, could not fairly be required. The
defences of Montreal were such as required ten times
his force to overcome. The regular troops defending
Montreal were not stationed in the town itself,
which was sufficiently protected by a broad river and
rapids. They were chiefly at Chambly, St. John’s,
Isle aux Noix, or other points on the Richelieu River,
guarding the most dangerous line of approach from
Lake Champlain; or they were at Coteau du Lac on
the St. Lawrence about twenty miles northwest of
Hampton’s position. According to the general weekly
return of British forces serving in the Montreal District
under command of Major-General Sir R.&nbsp;H.
Sheaffe, Sept. 15, 1813, the aggregate rank-and-file
present for duty was five thousand seven hundred
and fifty-two. At Montreal were none but sick, with
the general staff. At Chambly were nearly thirteen
hundred effectives; at St. John’s nearly eight hundred;
at Isle aux Noix about nine hundred. Excluding<span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span>
the garrison at Prescott, and including the
force at Coteau du Lac, Major-General Sheaffe commanded
just five thousand effectives.<a id="FNanchor_268" href="#Footnote_268" class="fnanchor">268</a></p>

<p>Besides the enrolled troops, Prevost could muster a
considerable number of sailors and marines for the
defence of Montreal; and his resources in artillery,
boats, fortifications, and supplies of all sorts were
ample. In addition to the embodied troops, Prevost
could count upon the militia, a force almost as good
as regulars for the defence of a forest-clad country
where axes were as effective as musketry in stopping
an invading army. In Prevost’s letter to Bathurst
of October 8, announcing Hampton’s invasion, the
governor-general <span class="locked">said:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Measures had been in the mean time taken by Major-General
Sir Roger Sheaffe commanding in this district,
to resist the advance of the enemy by moving the whole
of the troops under his command nearer to the frontier
line, and by calling out about three thousand of the
sedentary militia. I thought it necessary to increase
this latter force to nearly eight thousand by embodying
the whole of the sedentary militia upon the frontier,
this being in addition to the six battalions of incorporated
militia amounting to five thousand men; and
it is with peculiar satisfaction I have to report to your
Lordship that his Majesty’s Canadian subjects have
a second time answered the call to arms in defence
of their country with a zeal and alacrity beyond all
praise.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span></p>

<p>Thus the most moderate estimate of the British
force about Montreal gave at least fifteen thousand
rank-and-file under arms.<a id="FNanchor_269" href="#Footnote_269" class="fnanchor">269</a> Besides this large array
of men, Prevost was amply protected by natural defences.
If Hampton had reached the St. Lawrence
at Caughnawaga, he would still have been obliged to
cross the St. Lawrence, more than two miles wide,
under the fire of British batteries and gunboats.
Hampton had no transports. Prevost had bateaux
and vessels of every description, armed and unarmed,
above and below the rapids, besides two river steamers
constantly plying to Quebec.</p>

<p>Hampton’s command consisted of four thousand
infantry new to service, two hundred dragoons, and
artillery.<a id="FNanchor_270" href="#Footnote_270" class="fnanchor">270</a> With such a force, his chance of suffering
a fatal reverse was much greater than that of his
reaching the St. Lawrence. His position at the Chateaugay
was not less perilous than that of Harrison
on the Maumee, and far more so than that which
cost Dearborn so many disasters at Niagara.</p>

<p>The British force in Hampton’s immediate front
consisted at first of only three hundred militia, who
could make no resistance, and retired as Hampton
advanced. When Hampton made his movement to
Spear’s, Lieutenant-Colonel de Salaberry in his front
commanded about eight hundred men, and immediately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span>
entrenched himself and obstructed the road
with abattis.<a id="FNanchor_271" href="#Footnote_271" class="fnanchor">271</a> Hampton felt the necessity of dislodging
Salaberry, who might at any moment be reinforced;
and accordingly, in the night of October 25,
sent a strong force to flank Salaberry’s position, while
he should himself attack it in front.</p>

<p>The flanking party failed to find its way, and the
attack in front was not pressed.<a id="FNanchor_272" href="#Footnote_272" class="fnanchor">272</a> The American loss
did not exceed fifty men. The British loss was reported
as twenty-five. Sir George Prevost and his
officers were greatly pleased by their success;<a id="FNanchor_273" href="#Footnote_273" class="fnanchor">273</a> but
Prevost did not attempt to molest Hampton, who fell
back by slow marches to Chateaugay, where he waited
to hear from the Government. The British generals
at Montreal showed little energy in thus allowing
Hampton to escape; and the timidity of their attitude
before Hampton’s little army was the best proof
of the incompetence alleged against Prevost by many
of his contemporaries.</p>

<p>Hampton’s retreat was due more to the conduct
of Armstrong than to the check at Spear’s or to the
movements of Prevost. At the moment when he
moved against Salaberry, October 25, a messenger
arrived from Sackett’s Harbor, bringing instructions
from the quartermaster-general for building huts for
ten thousand men for winter quarters. These orders<span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span>
naturally roused Hampton’s suspicions that no serious
movement against Montreal was intended.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The papers sunk my hopes,” he wrote to Armstrong,
November 1,<a id="FNanchor_274" href="#Footnote_274" class="fnanchor">274</a> “and raised serious doubts of receiving
that efficacious support that had been anticipated. I
would have recalled the column, but it was in motion, and
the darkness of the night rendered it impracticable.”</p>
</div>

<p>In a separate letter of the same date<a id="FNanchor_275" href="#Footnote_275" class="fnanchor">275</a> which Hampton
sent to Armstrong by Colonel King, assuming
that the campaign was at an end, he carried out his
declared purpose of resigning. “Events,” he said,
“have had no tendency to change my opinion of the
destiny intended for me, nor my determination to retire
from a service where I can neither feel security
nor expect honor. The campaign I consider substantially
at an end.” The implication that Armstrong
meant to sacrifice him was certainly disrespectful,
and deserved punishment; but when Colonel King,
bearing these letters, arrived in the neighborhood of
Ogdensburg, he found that Armstrong had already
done what Hampton reproached him for intending to
do. He had retired to Albany, “suspecting ... that
the campaign ... would terminate as it did.”</p>

<p>A week afterward, November 8, Hampton received
a letter from Wilkinson, written from Ogdensburg,
asking him to forward supplies and march his troops<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
to some point of junction on the river below St.
Regis.<a id="FNanchor_276" href="#Footnote_276" class="fnanchor">276</a> Hampton replied from Chateaugay that he
had no supplies to forward; and as, under such
circumstances, his army could not throw itself on
Wilkinson’s scanty means, he should fall back on
Plattsburg, and attempt to act against the enemy
on some other road to be indicated.<a id="FNanchor_277" href="#Footnote_277" class="fnanchor">277</a> Wilkinson received
the letter on his arrival at Cornwall, November
12, the day after his defeat at Chrystler’s farm;
and with extraordinary energy moved the whole expedition
the next day to French Mills, six or seven
miles up the Salmon River, within the United States
lines, where it went into winter quarters.</p>

<p>Armstrong and Wilkinson made common cause in
throwing upon Hampton the blame of failure. Wilkinson
at first ordered Hampton under arrest, but
after reflection decided to throw the responsibility
upon Armstrong.<a id="FNanchor_278" href="#Footnote_278" class="fnanchor">278</a> The secretary declined to accept
it, but consented after some delay to accept Hampton’s
resignation when renewed in March, 1814.
Wilkinson declared that Hampton’s conduct had
blasted his dawning hopes and the honor of the
army.<a id="FNanchor_279" href="#Footnote_279" class="fnanchor">279</a> Armstrong sneered at Wilkinson for seizing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span>
the pretext for abandoning his campaign.<a id="FNanchor_280" href="#Footnote_280" class="fnanchor">280</a> Both the
generals believed that Armstrong had deliberately led
them into an impossible undertaking, and deserted
them, in order to shift the blame of failure from himself.<a id="FNanchor_281" href="#Footnote_281" class="fnanchor">281</a>
Hampton behaved with dignity, and allowed
his opinion to be seen only in his contemptuous
silence; nor did Armstrong publicly blame Hampton’s
conduct until Hampton was dead. The only
happy result of the campaign was to remove all the
older generals—Wilkinson, Hampton, and Morgan
Lewis—from active service.</p>

<p>The bloodless failure of an enterprise which might
have ended in extreme disaster was not the whole
cost of Armstrong’s and Wilkinson’s friendship and
quarrels. In November nearly all the regular forces,
both British and American, had been drawn toward
the St. Lawrence. Even Harrison and his troops,
who reached Buffalo October 24, were sent to Sackett’s
Harbor, November 16, to protect the navy. Not
a regiment of the United States army was to be
seen between Sackett’s Harbor and Detroit. The village
of Niagara and Fort George on the British side
were held by a few hundred volunteers commanded
by Brigadier-General McClure of the New York militia.
As long as Wilkinson and Hampton threatened
Montreal, Niagara was safe, and needed no
further attention.</p>

<p>After November 13, when Wilkinson and Hampton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_201">201</span>
withdrew from Canada, while the American army
forgot its enemy in the bitterness of its own personal
feuds, the British generals naturally thought of recovering
their lost posts on the Niagara River.
McClure, who occupied Fort George and the small
town of Newark under its guns, saw his garrison
constantly diminishing. Volunteers refused to serve
longer on any conditions.<a id="FNanchor_282" href="#Footnote_282" class="fnanchor">282</a> The War Department
ordered no reinforcements, although ten or twelve
thousand soldiers were lying idle at French Mills
and Plattsburg. December 10 McClure had about
sixty men of the Twenty-fourth infantry, and some
forty volunteers, at Fort George, while the number
of United States troops present for duty at Fort
George, Fort Niagara, Niagara village, Black Rock,
and Buffalo, to protect the people and the magazines,
amounted to four companies, or three hundred
and twenty-four men.</p>

<p>As early as October 4, Armstrong authorized
McClure to warn the inhabitants of Newark that their
town might suffer destruction in case the defence of
Fort George should render such a measure proper.<a id="FNanchor_283" href="#Footnote_283" class="fnanchor">283</a>
No other orders were given, but Wilkinson repeatedly
advised that Fort George should be evacuated,<a id="FNanchor_284" href="#Footnote_284" class="fnanchor">284</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>
and Armstrong did nothing to protect it, further
than to issue a requisition from Albany, November
25, upon the Governor of New York for one thousand
militia.<a id="FNanchor_285" href="#Footnote_285" class="fnanchor">285</a></p>

<p>The British, though not rapid in their movements,
were not so slow as the Americans. Early in December
Lieutenant-General Gordon Drummond came
from Kingston to York, and from York to the head
of the Lake where the British had maintained themselves
since losing the Niagara posts in May. Meanwhile
General Vincent had sent Colonel Murray with
five hundred men to retake Fort George. McClure
at Fort George, December 10, hearing that Murray
had approached within ten miles, evacuated the post
and crossed the river to Fort Niagara; but before
doing so he burned the town of Newark and as much
as he could of Queenston, turning the inhabitants,
in extreme cold, into the open air. He alleged as
his motive the wish to deprive the enemy of winter
quarters;<a id="FNanchor_286" href="#Footnote_286" class="fnanchor">286</a> yet he did not destroy the tents or military
barracks,<a id="FNanchor_287" href="#Footnote_287" class="fnanchor">287</a> and he acted without authority, for Armstrong
Had authorized him to burn Newark only in
case he meant to defend Fort George.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The enemy is much exasperated, and will make a
descent on this frontier if possible,” wrote McClure from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span>
the village of Niagara, December 13; “but I shall watch
them close with my handful of men until a reinforcement
of militia and volunteers arrives.... I am not a little
apprehensive that the enemy will take advantage of the
exposed condition of Buffalo and our shipping there.
My whole effective force on this extensive frontier does
not exceed two hundred and fifty men.”</p>
</div>

<p>Five days passed, and still no reinforcements arrived,
and no regular troops were even ordered to
start for Niagara. “I apprehended an attack,” wrote
McClure;<a id="FNanchor_288" href="#Footnote_288" class="fnanchor">288</a> and he retired thirty miles to Buffalo,
“with a view of providing for the defence.” On the
night of December 18 Colonel Murray, with five
hundred and fifty regular rank-and-file, crossed the
river from Fort George unperceived; surprised the
sentinels on the glacis and at the gates of Fort
Niagara; rushed through the main gate; and,
with a loss of eight men killed and wounded, captured
the fortress with some three hundred and fifty
prisoners.</p>

<p>Nothing could be said on the American side in
defence or excuse of this disgrace. From Armstrong
at the War Department to Captain Leonard who
commanded the fort, every one concerned in the
transaction deserved whatever punishment the law or
army regulations could inflict. The unfortunate people
of Niagara and Buffalo were victims to official
misconduct. The British, thinking themselves released<span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span>
from ordinary rules of war by the burning of
Newark and Queenston, showed unusual ferocity. In
the assault on Fort Niagara they killed sixty-seven
Americans, all by the bayonet, while they wounded
only eleven. Immediately afterward they “let loose”<a id="FNanchor_289" href="#Footnote_289" class="fnanchor">289</a>
their auxiliary Indians on Lewiston and the country
around. On the night of December 29, Lieutenant-General
Drummond sent a force of fifteen hundred
men including Indians<a id="FNanchor_290" href="#Footnote_290" class="fnanchor">290</a> across the river above the
falls, and driving away the militia, burned Black
Rock and Buffalo with all their public stores and
three small war-schooners.<a id="FNanchor_291" href="#Footnote_291" class="fnanchor">291</a></p>

<p>These acts of retaliation were justified by Sir
George Prevost in a long proclamation<a id="FNanchor_292" href="#Footnote_292" class="fnanchor">292</a> dated Jan.
12, 1814, which promised that he would not “pursue
further a system of warfare so revolting to his own
feelings and so little congenial to the British character
unless the future measures of the enemy should compel
him again to resort to it.” The Americans themselves
bore Drummond’s excessive severity with less
complaint than usual. They partly suspected that
the destruction effected on the Thames, at York and
at Newark, by American troops, though unauthorized
by orders, had warranted some retaliation; but they
felt more strongly that their anger should properly
be vented on their own government and themselves,
who had allowed a handful of British troops to capture<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
a strong fortress and to ravage thirty miles of
frontier, after repeated warning, without losing two
hundred men on either side, while thousands of regular
troops were idle elsewhere, and the neighborhood
ought without an effort to have supplied five thousand
militia.</p>

<p>Fort Niagara, which thus fell into British hands,
remained, like Mackinaw, in the enemy’s possession
until the peace.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Military</span> movements in the Southern department
attracted little notice, but were not the less important.
The Southern people entered into the war in the
hope of obtaining the Floridas. President Madison,
like President Jefferson, gave all the support in his
power to the scheme. Throughout the year 1812
United States troops still occupied Amelia Island
and the St. Mary’s River, notwithstanding the refusal
of Congress to authorize the occupation. The
President expected Congress at the session of 1812–1813
to approve the seizure of both Floridas, and
took measures in advance for that purpose.</p>

<p>October 12, 1812, Secretary Eustis wrote to the
Governor of Tennessee calling out fifteen hundred
militia for the defence of the “lower country.” The
force was not intended for defence but for conquest;
it was to support the seizure of Mobile, Pensacola,
and St. Augustine by the regular troops. For that
object every man in Tennessee was ready to serve;
and of all Tennesseeans, Andrew Jackson was the
most ardent. Governor Blount immediately authorized
Jackson, as major-general of the State militia,
to call out two thousand volunteers. The call was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span>
issued November 14; the volunteers collected at
Nashville December 10; and Jan. 7, 1813, the infantry
embarked in boats to descend the river, while
the mounted men rode through the Indian country
to Natchez.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have the pleasure to inform you,” wrote Jackson
to Eustis in departing,<a id="FNanchor_293" href="#Footnote_293" class="fnanchor">293</a> “that I am now at the head of
two thousand and seventy volunteers, the choicest of our
citizens, who go at the call of their country to execute
the will of the Government; who have no Constitutional
scruples, and if the Government orders, will rejoice at
the opportunity of placing the American eagle on the ramparts
of Mobile, Pensacola, and Fort St. Augustine.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Tennessee army reached Natchez, February 15,
and went into camp to wait orders from Washington,
which were expected to direct an advance on Mobile
and Pensacola.</p>

<p>While Jackson descended the Mississippi, Monroe,
then acting Secretary of War, wrote, January 13, to
Major-General Pinckney,<a id="FNanchor_294" href="#Footnote_294" class="fnanchor">294</a> whose military department
included Georgia: “It is intended to place under
your command an adequate force for the reduction
of St. Augustine should it be decided on by Congress,
before whom the subject will be in a few days.” A
fortnight later, January 30, Monroe wrote also to
Wilkinson,<a id="FNanchor_295" href="#Footnote_295" class="fnanchor">295</a> then commanding at New Orleans: “The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_208">208</span>
subject of taking possession of West Florida is now
before Congress, and will probably pass. You will
be prepared to carry into effect this measure should
it be decided on.”</p>

<p>Neither Madison nor Monroe raised objection to
the seizure of territory belonging to a friendly power;
but Congress showed no such readiness to act. Senator
Anderson of Tennessee, as early as Dec. 10,
1812, moved,<a id="FNanchor_296" href="#Footnote_296" class="fnanchor">296</a> in secret session of the Senate, that
a committee be appointed to consider the expediency
of authorizing the President “to occupy and hold the
whole or any part of East Florida, including Amelia
Island, and also those parts of West Florida which
are not now in the possession and under the jurisdiction
of the United States.” After much debate
the Senate, December 22, adopted the resolution by
eighteen votes to twelve, and the committee, consisting
of Anderson, Samuel Smith, Tait of Georgia,
Varnum of Massachusetts, and Goodrich of Connecticut,
reported a bill,<a id="FNanchor_297" href="#Footnote_297" class="fnanchor">297</a> January 19, authorizing the
President to occupy both Floridas, and to exercise
government there, “provided ... that the section
of country herein designated that is situated to the
eastward of the river Perdido may be the subject of
future negotiation.”</p>

<p>The bill met opposition from the President’s personal
enemies, Giles, Leib, and Samuel Smith, as well
as from the Federalists and some of the Northern<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
Democrats. January 26, Samuel Smith moved to
strike out the second section, which authorized the
seizure of Florida east of the Perdido; and the Senate,
February 2, by a vote of nineteen to sixteen,
adopted Smith’s motion. The vote was sectional.
North and South Carolina, Georgia, Tennessee, and
Louisiana supported the bill; Maryland, Delaware,
Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, and Rhode
Island opposed it; Virginia, Kentucky, Ohio, Massachusetts,
New Hampshire, and Vermont were divided;
New Jersey threw one vote in its favor, the second
senator being absent. Had Leib not changed sides
the next day, the whole bill would have been indefinitely
postponed; but the majority rallied, February
5, and by a vote of twenty-one to eleven authorized
the President to seize Florida west of the
Perdido, or, in other words, to occupy Mobile. The
House passed the bill in secret session February 9,
and the President signed it February 12.<a id="FNanchor_298" href="#Footnote_298" class="fnanchor">298</a></p>

<p>In refusing to seize East Florida, the Senate greatly
disarranged Madison’s plans. Three days afterward,
February 5, Armstrong took charge of the War Department,
and his first orders were sent to Andrew
Jackson directing him to dismiss his force, “the
causes of embodying and marching to New Orleans
the corps under your command having ceased to
exist.”<a id="FNanchor_299" href="#Footnote_299" class="fnanchor">299</a> Jackson, ignorant that the Administration
was not to blame, and indignant at his curt dismissal,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>
marched his men back to Tennessee, making himself
responsible for their pay and rations. On learning
these circumstances, Armstrong wrote, March 22, a
friendly letter thanking him for the important services
his corps would have rendered “had the Executive
policy of occupying the two Floridas been adopted
by the national legislature.”<a id="FNanchor_300" href="#Footnote_300" class="fnanchor">300</a></p>

<p>After the Senate had so persistently refused to
support Madison’s occupation of East Florida, he
could hardly maintain longer the illegal possession
he had held during the past year of Amelia Island.
February 15, Armstrong wrote to Major-General
Pinckney,<a id="FNanchor_301" href="#Footnote_301" class="fnanchor">301</a> “The late private proceedings of Congress
have resulted in a decision not to invade East
Florida at present;” but not until March 7, did the
secretary order Pinckney to withdraw the troops
from Amelia Island and Spanish territory.<a id="FNanchor_302" href="#Footnote_302" class="fnanchor">302</a></p>

<p>The troops were accordingly withdrawn from
Amelia Island, May 16; but nothing could restore
East Florida to its former repose, and the anarchy
which had been introduced from the United States
could never be mastered except by the power that
created it. Perhaps Madison would have retained
possession, as the least of evils, in spite of the
Senate’s vote of February 3, had not another cause,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
independent of legislative will, overcome his repugnance
to the evacuation. The Russian offer of
mediation arrived while the President was still in
doubt. The occupation of Florida, being an act of
war against Spain, could not fail to excite the anger
of England, and in that feeling of displeasure the
Czar must inevitably share. From the moment their
cause against Napoleon was common, Russia, England,
and Spain were more than likely to act together
in resistance to any territorial aggression upon any
member of their alliance, the evacuation of East
Florida by the United States evaded a serious diplomatic
difficulty; and probably not by mere coincidence,
Armstrong’s order to evacuate Amelia Island
was dated March 7, while Daschkoff’s letter offering
the Czar’s mediation was dated March 8.</p>

<p>The Cabinet was so little united in support of the
Executive policy that Madison and Monroe ordered
the seizure of Mobile without consulting Gallatin,
whose persistent hostility to the Florida intrigues
was notorious. When Monroe in April gave to Gallatin
and Bayard the President’s instructions<a id="FNanchor_303" href="#Footnote_303" class="fnanchor">303</a> for
the peace negotiations, among the rest he directed
them to assert “a right to West Florida by cession
from France, and a claim to East Florida as
an indemnity for spoliations.” On receiving these
instructions, Gallatin wrote to Monroe, May 2,
<span class="locked">asking,<a id="FNanchor_304" href="#Footnote_304" class="fnanchor">304</a>—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Where is the importance of taking possession of
Mobile this summer? We may do this whenever we
please, and is it not better to delay every operation of
minor importance which may have a tendency to impede
our negotiations with Great Britain and Russia? You
know that to take by force any place in possession of
another nation, whatever our claim to that place may be,
is war; and you must be aware that both Russia and
Great Britain will feel disposed, if not to support the
pretensions of Spain against us, at least to take part
against the aggressor.”</p>
</div>

<p>Monroe quickly replied:<a id="FNanchor_305" href="#Footnote_305" class="fnanchor">305</a> “With respect to West
Florida, possession will be taken of it before you get
far on your voyage. That is a question settled.” In
fact, possession had been taken of it three weeks
before he wrote, in pursuance of orders sent in
February, apparently without Gallatin’s knowledge.
Monroe added views of his own, singularly opposed
to Gallatin’s convictions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the subject of East Florida,” wrote Monroe to
Gallatin, May 6,<a id="FNanchor_306" href="#Footnote_306" class="fnanchor">306</a> “I think I intimated to you in my last
that Colonel Lear was under the most perfect conviction,
on the authority of information from respectable sources
at Cadiz, that the Spanish regency had sold that and the
other province to the British government, and that it
had done so under a belief that we had, or should soon
get, possession of it. My firm belief is that if we were
possessed of both, it would facilitate your negotiations in
favor of impressment and every other object, especially if<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
it was distinctly seen by the British ministers or minister
that, instead of yielding them or any part of either, we
would push our fortunes in that direction, and in Canada,
if they did not hasten to accommodate.”</p>
</div>

<p>Gallatin, on the eve of sailing for Russia, replied
with good temper, expressing opinions contrary to
those of the President and Secretary of State.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“On the subject of Florida,” Gallatin said,<a id="FNanchor_307" href="#Footnote_307" class="fnanchor">307</a> “I have
always differed in opinion with you, and am rejoiced to
have it in our power to announce the evacuation of the
province. Let it alone until you shall, by the introduction
of British troops, have a proof of the supposed cession.
In this I do not believe. It can be nothing more
than a permission to occupy it in order to defend it for
Spain. By withdrawing our troops, we withdraw the
pretence; but the impolitic occupancy of Mobile will, I
fear, renew our difficulties. The object is at present of
very minor importance, swelled into consequence by the
representations from that quarter, and which I would
not at this moment have attempted, among other reasons,
because it was a Southern one, and will, should it involve
us in a war with Spain, disgust every man north of
Washington. You will pardon the freedom with which,
on the eve of parting with you, I speak on this subject.
It is intended as a general caution, which I think important,
because I know and see every day the extent of
geographical feeling, and the necessity of prudence if we
mean to preserve and invigorate the Union.”</p>
</div>

<p>No sooner did the Act of February 12 become law
than Armstrong wrote, February 16, to Wilkinson at<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span>
New Orleans, enclosing a copy of the Act, and ordering
him immediately to take possession of Mobile and
the country as far as the Perdido.<a id="FNanchor_308" href="#Footnote_308" class="fnanchor">308</a> Wilkinson, who
had for years looked forward to that step, hastened
to obey the instruction. When Gallatin remonstrated,
the measure had been already taken and could not be
recalled.</p>

<p>Since July 9, 1812, Wilkinson had again commanded
at New Orleans. No immediate attack was
to be feared, nor could a competent British force be
collected there without warning; but in case such an
attack should be made, Wilkinson had reason to fear
the result, for his regular force consisted of only sixteen
hundred effectives, ill equipped and without defences.<a id="FNanchor_309" href="#Footnote_309" class="fnanchor">309</a>
The War Department ordered him to depend
on movable ordnance and temporary works rather
than on permanent fortifications;<a id="FNanchor_310" href="#Footnote_310" class="fnanchor">310</a> but with his usual
disregard of orders he began the construction or the
completion of extensive works at various points on
the river and coast, at a cost which the government
could ill afford.</p>

<p>While engaged in this task Wilkinson received,
March 14, Armstrong’s order of February 16 for the
invasion of West Florida. When the government’s
orders were agreeable to Wilkinson, they reached him<span class="pagenum" id="Page_215">215</span>
promptly and were executed with rapidity. Within
three weeks he collected at Pass Christian a force of
about six hundred men, supported by gunboats, and
entered the Bay of Mobile on the night of April 10,
while at the same time the garrison at Fort Stoddert
descended the Tensaw River, and cut the communication
by land between Mobile and Pensacola. At that
time Mobile Point was undefended. The only Spanish
fortress was Fort Charlotte at Mobile, garrisoned by
one hundred and fifty combatants. Wilkinson summoned
the fort to surrender, and the commandant
had no choice but to obey, for the place was untenable
and without supplies. The surrender took place
April 15. Wilkinson then took possession of the
country as far as the Perdido, and began the construction
of a fort, to be called Fort Bowyer, on Mobile
Point at the entrance of the Bay, some sixty miles
below the town.<a id="FNanchor_311" href="#Footnote_311" class="fnanchor">311</a></p>

<p>This conquest, the only permanent gain of territory
made during the war, being effected without bloodshed,
attracted less attention than it deserved. Wilkinson
committed no errors, and won the President’s
warm approval.<a id="FNanchor_312" href="#Footnote_312" class="fnanchor">312</a> Wilkinson was greatly pleased by
his own success, and wished to remain at New Orleans
to carry out his projected defences; but Armstrong
had written as early as March 10, ordering him to
the Lakes. As so often happened with orders that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span>
displeased the general, Armstrong’s letter, though
dated March 10, and doubtless arriving in New
Orleans before April 10, was received by Wilkinson
only on his return, May 19. After another delay of
three weeks, he started northward, and travelled
by way of Mobile through the Creek country to
Washington.</p>

<p>Wilkinson’s departure, June 10, and the evacuation
of Amelia Island by General Pinckney May 16, closed
the first chapter of the war in the South. Armstrong
wrote to Wilkinson, May 27:<a id="FNanchor_313" href="#Footnote_313" class="fnanchor">313</a> “The mission to
Petersburg and the instructions to our envoys will
put a barrier between you and Pensacola for some
time to come at least, and permanently in case of
peace.” The sudden stop thus put by the Senate
and the Russian mediation to the campaign against
Pensacola and St. Augustine deranged the plans of
Georgia and Tennessee, arrested the career of Andrew
Jackson, and caused the transfer of Wilkinson from
New Orleans to the Lakes. The government expected
no other difficulties in the Southern country,
and had no reason to fear them. If new perils suddenly
arose, they were due less to England, Spain,
or the United States than to the chance that gave
energy and influence to Tecumthe.</p>

<p>The Southern Indians were more docile and less
warlike than the Indians of the Lakes. The Chickasaws
and Choctaws, who occupied the whole extent of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
country on the east bank of the Mississippi River
from the Ohio to the Gulf, gave little trouble or
anxiety; and even the great confederacy of Muskogees,
or Creeks, who occupied the territory afterward
called the State of Alabama and part of Georgia, fell
in some degree into a mode of life which seemed
likely to make them tillers of the soil. In 1800 the
Creeks held, or claimed, about three hundred miles
square from the Tennessee River to the Gulf, and
from the middle of Georgia nearly to the line which
afterward marked the State of Mississippi. The
Seminoles, or wild men, of Florida were a branch of
the Muskogees, and the Creek warriors themselves
were in the habit of visiting Pensacola and Mobile,
where they expected to receive presents from the
Spanish governor.</p>

<p>Two thirds of the Creek towns were on the Coosa
and Tallapoosa rivers in the heart of Alabama.
Their inhabitants were called Upper Creeks. The
Lower Creeks lived in towns on the Chattahooche
River, the modern boundary between Alabama and
Georgia. The United States government, following
a different policy in 1799 from that of Jefferson
toward the Northwestern Indians, induced the Creeks
to adopt a national organization for police purposes;
it also helped them to introduce ploughs, to learn
cotton-spinning, and to raise crops. The success of
these experiments was not at first great, for the
larger number of Indians saw no advantage in becoming
laborers, and preferred sitting in the squares<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
of the towns, or hunting; but here and there chiefs
or half-breeds had farms, slaves, stock, orchards, and
spinning-wheels.</p>

<p>Large as the Creek country was, and wild as it had
ever been, it did not abound in game. A good hunter,
passing in any direction through the three hundred
miles of Alabama and Georgia, found difficulty in
obtaining game enough for his support.<a id="FNanchor_314" href="#Footnote_314" class="fnanchor">314</a> For that
reason the Seminoles left their old towns and became
wild people, as their name implied, making irregular
settlements in Florida, where game and food were
more plenty. The mass of the Creek nation, fixed in
the villages in the interior, clung to their habits of
hunting even when obliged to cultivate the soil, and
their semi-civilization rendered them a more perplexing
obstacle to the whites than though they had
obstinately resisted white influence.</p>

<p>Had the Indian problem been left to the people
of Georgia and Tennessee, the Indians would soon
have disappeared; but the national government established
under President Washington in 1789 put a
sharp curb on Georgia, and interposed decisively
between the Georgians and the Creeks.<a id="FNanchor_315" href="#Footnote_315" class="fnanchor">315</a> President
Washington in 1796 appointed Benjamin Hawkins of
North Carolina as Indian agent among the Creeks,
and Hawkins protected and governed them with devotion;
but the result of his friendliness was the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span>
same as that of others’ greed. The Indians slowly
lost ground.</p>

<p>The Creeks complained of grievances similar to
those of the Northwestern Indians, and their position
was even more helpless. They had no other
outlet than Pensacola and Mobile. Except from the
Spaniards they could expect no aid in case of trouble,
and the Spanish governors of Florida, after the abdication
of Carlos IV. in 1807, could scarcely maintain
their own position, much less supply the Creeks
with arms or gunpowder. While the Northwestern
Indians could buy at Malden all the weapons and
ammunition they wanted, the Creeks possessed few
firearms, and these in bad condition; nor were they
skilful in using guns.</p>

<p>The United States government prevented the Georgians
from compelling the Indians to sell their lands,
but nothing could prevent them from trespass; and
the Indian woods along the frontier were filled with
cattle, horses, and hogs belonging to the whites, while
white men destroyed the game, hunting the deer by
firelight, and scaring the Indian hunters from their
hunting-grounds. “Every cane-swamp where they
go to look for a bear—which is part of their support—is
near eat out by the stocks put over by
the citizens of Georgia.”<a id="FNanchor_316" href="#Footnote_316" class="fnanchor">316</a> This complaint was made
in 1796, and as time went on the Indian hunting-grounds
were more rapidly narrowed. Not only from<span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span>
Georgia but also from Fort Stoddert, along the course
of the Tombigbee River, above Mobile, intruders
pressed into the Creek country. The Indians had
no choice but to sell their lands for annuities, and
under this pressure the Creeks, in 1802 and 1803,
were induced to part with the district between the
Oconee and Ocmulgee in the centre of Georgia.
They retained their towns on the Chattahoochee,
where Hawkins’s agency was established in the town
of Coweta, on the edge of the Creek country.</p>

<p>Hawkins was satisfied with their behavior, and
believed the chiefs to be well disposed. They showed
none of the restlessness which characterized the
Northwestern Indians, until Tecumthe conceived the
idea of bringing them into his general league to
check the encroachments of the whites. After Tecumthe’s
interview with Governor Harrison at Vincennes,
in July, 1811, he made a long journey
through the Chickasaw and Choctaw country, and
arrived among the Creeks in October, bringing with
him a score of Indian warriors. The annual council
of the Creeks was held in that month at the
village of Tuckaubatchee,—an ancient town of the
Upper Creeks on the Tallapoosa. The rumor that
Tecumthe would be present brought great numbers
of Indians, even Cherokees and Choctaws, to the
place, while Hawkins attended the council in his
character as agent.</p>

<p>Tecumthe and his warriors marched into the centre
of the square and took their places in silence. That<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
night “they danced the dance of the Indians of the
Lakes,” which became thenceforward a political symbol
of their party among the Creeks. Some nights
afterward Tecumthe addressed the council. Versions
more or less untrustworthy have been given of
the speech;<a id="FNanchor_317" href="#Footnote_317" class="fnanchor">317</a> but the only official allusion to it by a
person entitled to credit seemed to show that it was
in substance the address made by Tecumthe at Vincennes.
Hawkins, recalling to the Creek chiefs in
1814 the course of events which had caused their
troubles, reminded them how “Tecumseh, in the
square of Tuckaubatchee, ... told the Creeks not
to do any injury to the Americans; to be in peace
and friendship with them; not to steal even a bell
from any one of any color. Let the white people
on this continent manage their affairs their own
way. Let the red people manage their affairs their
own way.”<a id="FNanchor_318" href="#Footnote_318" class="fnanchor">318</a> Hawkins and the old chiefs would
have certainly interfered had Tecumthe incited
the Creeks to war or violence; but according to
Hawkins the speech was a pacific “talk,” delivered
by Tecumthe in the name of the British. Indian
tradition preserved another form of Tecumthe’s
rhetoric, which seemed to complete the identity with
the Vincennes address. Unable to express himself
in the Muskogee language, Tecumthe used pantomime
familiar to Indians. Holding his war-club<span class="pagenum" id="Page_222">222</span>
with outstretched arm, he opened first the little
finger, then the next and the next, till the club fell
from his hand.</p>

<p>Indian union was unquestionably the chief theme
of all Tecumthe’s public addresses. Whether in private
he taught other doctrines must be matter of
surmise; but he certainly brought into the Creek
nation a religious fanaticism of a peculiar and dangerous
kind. Prophets soon appeared, chiefly among
the Alabamas, a remnant of an ancient race, not of
Creek blood, but members of the Creek confederacy.<a id="FNanchor_319" href="#Footnote_319" class="fnanchor">319</a>
The prophets, with the usual phenomena of hysteria,
claimed powers of magic, and promised to bring
earthquakes to destroy an invading army. They
preached the total destruction of everything, animate
and inanimate, that pertained to civilization. As
the nation generally was badly armed, and relied
chiefly on their bows, arrows, and war-clubs for battle,<a id="FNanchor_320" href="#Footnote_320" class="fnanchor">320</a>
the moral support of magic was needed to give
them confidence.</p>

<p>So secret was the influence of Tecumthe’s friends
that no suspicion of the excitement reached Hawkins
even when the war with England began; and the old
chiefs of the nation—known to be devoted to peace
and to the white alliance—were kept in ignorance
of all that was done among the young warriors. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span>
Alabamas, or Coosadas, lived below the junction of
the Coosa and Tallapoosa, on the west bank of the
Alabama River, about eight miles above the modern
town of Montgomery; they were considered by Hawkins
the most industrious and best behaved of all
the Creeks, whose fields were the granaries of the
upper towns and furnished supplies even to Mobile.
Their town was the last place in which Hawkins expected
to see conspiracy, violence, or fanaticism. The
young men “sang the song of the Indians of the
Lakes, and danced the dance” in secret for eighteen
months after Tecumthe’s visit, without public alarm,
and probably would have continued to do so except
for an outbreak committed by some of their nation
three hundred miles away.</p>

<p>In 1812 a band of six Indians led by the Little
Warrior of Wewocau, a Creek town on the Coosa,
was sent by the nation on a public mission to the
Chickasaws.<a id="FNanchor_321" href="#Footnote_321" class="fnanchor">321</a> Instead of delivering their “talks” and
returning, they continued their journey to the northern
Lakes and joined Tecumthe at Malden. They
took part in the massacre at the river Raisin, Jan.
22, 1813, and soon afterward began their return,
bringing talks from the Shawanese and British and
also a letter from some British officer at Malden to
the Spanish officials at Pensacola, from whom they
hoped to obtain weapons and powder. According to
common report, Tecumthe told the Little Warrior<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
that he was about to aid the British in capturing
Fort Meigs, and as soon as the fort was taken he
would come to join the Creeks.<a id="FNanchor_322" href="#Footnote_322" class="fnanchor">322</a> Until then his
friends were to increase their party by the secret
means and magic that had proved so successful, but
were not to begin open war.<a id="FNanchor_323" href="#Footnote_323" class="fnanchor">323</a></p>

<p>The Little Warrior and his party, including a
warrior from Tuskegee, a Creek town at the fork of
the Coosa and Tallapoosa, after crossing Indiana in
the month of February reached the north bank of
the Ohio River about seven miles above its mouth,
where were two cabins occupied by white families.<a id="FNanchor_324" href="#Footnote_324" class="fnanchor">324</a>
Unable to resist the temptation to spill blood, the
band murdered the two families with the usual Indian
horrors. This outrage was committed February 9;
and the band, crossing the Ohio, passed southward
through the Chickasaw country, avowing the deed
and its motive.<a id="FNanchor_325" href="#Footnote_325" class="fnanchor">325</a></p>

<p>The Little Warrior arrived at home about the
middle of March, and reported that he brought talks
from the Shawanese and British. The old chiefs of
the Upper Creeks immediately held a council March
25, and after listening to the talks, reprimanded the
Little Warrior and ordered him to leave the Council<span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span>
House.<a id="FNanchor_326" href="#Footnote_326" class="fnanchor">326</a> On the same day Hawkins wrote to them
from Coweta, demanding delivery of the Little Warrior
and his six companions to answer for the murders
they had committed. On hearing this demand,
the old chiefs at Tuckaubatchee under the lead of
the Big Warrior held another council, while the
Little Warrior, the Tuskegee Warrior, and the murderers
took to the woods. The old chiefs in council
decided to execute the murderers, and sent out parties
to do it. The Little Warrior was found in the
swamp, well armed, but was decoyed out and killed
by treachery; “the first and second man’s gun
snapped at him, but the third man’s gun fired and
killed; ... four men that had on pouches kept
them shaking following after him, so that he could
not hear the gun snap; if he had found out that,
he would have wounded a good many with his
arrows.”<a id="FNanchor_327" href="#Footnote_327" class="fnanchor">327</a></p>

<p>The Tuskegee warrior and four others were found
in a house on the Hickory Ground at the fork of the
rivers. As long as they had ammunition, they held
the attack at a distance, but at last the house was
fired. The Tuskegee Warrior being wounded, was
burned in the house, while his two young brothers
were taken out and tomahawked. One warrior broke
away, but was caught and killed; two more were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
killed elsewhere. One escaped, and “set out the
morning after to kill white people.” Warriors were
sent after him.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He made battle, firing at the warriors, and was near
killing one; the bullet passed near his ear. He then
drew his knife and tomahawk, defended himself, and
the warriors shot three balls through him. He fell,
retained the power of speech till next day, and died.
He said he had been to the Shawanese helping of them,
and had got fat eating white people’s flesh. Every one
to the very last called on the Shawanese general,
Tecumseh.”<a id="FNanchor_328" href="#Footnote_328" class="fnanchor">328</a></p>

<p>Such political executions, in the stifled excitement
of the moment, could not but rouse violent emotion
throughout the Creek nation. The old chiefs, having
given life for life, felt the stronger for their assertion
of authority; but they knew nothing of the true situation.
For several weeks no open outbreak occurred,
but the prophets were more active than ever. About
June 4 the old chiefs at Tuckaubatchee, hearing that
the prophets “kept as usual their fooleries,” sent a
runner to the Alabamas with a <span class="locked">message:<a id="FNanchor_329" href="#Footnote_329" class="fnanchor">329</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“You are but a few Alabama people. You say that
the Great Spirit visits you frequently; that he comes in
the sun and speaks to you; that the sun comes down
just above your heads. Now we want to see and hear
what you say you have seen and heard. Let us have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span>
the same proof you have had, and we will believe what
we see and hear. You have nothing to fear; the people
who committed murders have suffered for their crimes,
and there is an end of it.”</p>
</div>

<p>The runner who carried this message was one of
the warriors who had aided in killing the seven
murderers. The Alabamas instantly put him to
death, and sent his scalp to their friends at the forks
of the river. Then began a general uprising, and
every warrior who had aided in killing the murderers
was himself killed or hunted from the Upper
Creek country. The chiefs of Tuckaubatchee with
difficulty escaped to the agency at Coweta, where
they were under the protection of Georgia.</p>

<p>The Lower Creek towns did not join the outbreak;
but of the Upper Creek towns twenty-nine declared
for war, and only five for peace. At least two thousand
warriors were believed to have taken the war-club
by August 1, and got the name of Red Clubs,
or Red Sticks, for that reason. Everywhere they
destroyed farms, stock, and all objects of white civilization,
and killed or drove away their opponents.<a id="FNanchor_330" href="#Footnote_330" class="fnanchor">330</a></p>

<p>With all this the Spaniards had nothing to do.
The outbreak was caused by the Indian War in the
Northwest, and immediately by the incompetence of
General Winchester and by the massacre at the
river Raisin. The Creeks were totally unprepared
for war, except so far as they trusted to magic;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span>
they had neither guns, powder, nor balls. For that
reason they turned to the Spaniards, who could alone
supply them. When the Little Warrior was put to
death, the British letter which he carried from Malden
for the Spanish officials at Pensacola came into
the charge of another Creek warrior, Peter McQueen,
a half-breed. In July, McQueen, with a large party
of warriors started for Pensacola, with the letter and
four hundred dollars, to get powder.<a id="FNanchor_331" href="#Footnote_331" class="fnanchor">331</a> On arriving
there they saw the Spanish governor, who treated
them civilly, and in fear of violence gave them, according
to McQueen’s account,<a id="FNanchor_332" href="#Footnote_332" class="fnanchor">332</a> “a small bag of powder
each for ten towns, and five bullets to each man.”
With this supply, which the governor represented as
a friendly present for hunting purposes, they were
obliged to content themselves, and started on their
return journey.</p>

<p>News that McQueen’s party was at Pensacola
instantly reached the American settlements above
Mobile, where the inhabitants were already taking
refuge in stockades.<a id="FNanchor_333" href="#Footnote_333" class="fnanchor">333</a> A large number of Americans,
without military organization, under several leaders,
one of whom was a half-breed named Dixon Bailey,
started July 26 to intercept McQueen, and succeeded
in surprising the Indians July 27 at a place called<span class="pagenum" id="Page_229">229</span>
Burnt Corn, about eighty miles north of Pensacola.
The whites at first routed the Indians, and captured
the pack-mules with the ammunition; but the Indians
quickly rallied, and in their turn routed the whites,
with a loss of two killed and fifteen wounded,—although
they failed to recover the greater part of
the pack-animals. With the small amount of powder
left to him, McQueen then returned to his
people.</p>

<p>Angry at the attack and eager to revenge the death
of his warriors, McQueen summoned the warriors of
thirteen towns, some eight hundred in number, and
about August 20 started in search of his enemies.
The Creek war differed from that on the Lakes in
being partly a war of half-breeds. McQueen’s strongest
ally was William Weatherford, a half-breed, well
known throughout the country as a man of property
and ability, as nearly civilized as Indian blood permitted,
and equally at home among Indians and
whites. McQueen and Weatherford were bitterly
hostile to the half-breeds Bailey and Beasley, who
were engaged in the affair of Burnt Corn.<a id="FNanchor_334" href="#Footnote_334" class="fnanchor">334</a> Both
Beasley and Bailey were at a stockade called Fort
Mims, some thirty-five miles above Mobile, on the
eastern side of the Alabama River, where about five
hundred and fifty persons were collected,—a motley
crowd of whites, half-breeds, Indians, and negroes, old
and young, women and children, protected only by a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span>
picket wall, pierced by five hundred loop-holes three
and a half feet from the ground, and two rude gates.<a id="FNanchor_335" href="#Footnote_335" class="fnanchor">335</a>
Beasley commanded, and wrote, August 80, that he
could “maintain the post against any number of Indians.”<a id="FNanchor_336" href="#Footnote_336" class="fnanchor">336</a>
To Fort Mims the Creek warriors turned,
for the reason that Beasley and Bailey were there, and
they arrived in the neighborhood, August 29, without
giving alarm. Twice, negroes tending cattle outside
rushed back to the fort reporting that painted warriors
were hovering about; but the horsemen when
sent out discovered no sign of an enemy, and Beasley
tied up and flogged the second negro for giving a
false alarm.</p>

<p>At noon, August 30, when the drum beat for dinner
no patrols were out, the gates were open, and
sand had drifted against that on the eastern side
so that it could not quickly be closed. Suddenly
a swarm of Indians raising the warwhoop rushed
toward the fort. Beasley had time to reach the
gate, but could not close it, and was tomahawked on
the spot. The Indians got possession of the loop-holes
outside, and of one inclosure. The whites,
under Dixon Bailey, held the inner inclosure and
fought with desperation; but at last the Indians
succeeded in setting fire to the house in the centre,
and the fire spread to the whole stockade. The
Indians then effected an entrance, and massacred
most of the inmates. Fifteen persons escaped, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>
among these was Dixon Bailey mortally wounded.
Most of the negroes were spared to be slaves. Two
hundred and fifty scalps became trophies of the
Creek warriors,—a number such as had been seldom
taken by Indians from the white people on a
single day.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> battle at Burnt Corn was regarded by the
Indians as a declaration of war by the whites. Till
then they seemed to consider themselves engaged in a
domestic quarrel, or civil war;<a id="FNanchor_337" href="#Footnote_337" class="fnanchor">337</a> but after the massacre
at Fort Mims they could not retreat, and yet knew that
they must perish except for supernatural aid. Their
destiny was controlled by that of Tecumthe. Ten
days after the massacre at Fort Mims, Perry won his
victory on Lake Erie, which settled the result of the
Indian wars both in the North and in the South.
Tecumthe had expected to capture Fort Meigs, and
with it Fort Wayne and the line of the Maumee and
Wabash. On the impulse of this success he probably
hoped to raise the war-spirit among the Chickasaws
and Choctaws, and then in person to call the Creeks
into the field. Proctor’s successive defeats blasted
Indian hopes, and the Creeks had hardly struck their
first blow in his support when Tecumthe himself fell,
and the Indians of the Lakes submitted or fled to
Canada.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span></p>

<p>At best, the Creek outbreak would have been hopeless.
Although the number of hostile Creek warriors
was matter of conjecture, nothing showed that they
could exceed four thousand. At Pensacola, Peter
McQueen was said to have claimed forty-eight hundred
“gun-men” on his side.<a id="FNanchor_338" href="#Footnote_338" class="fnanchor">338</a> At such a moment
he probably exaggerated his numbers. The Big Warrior,
who led the peace party, estimated the hostile
Creeks, early in August, as numbering at least twenty-five
hundred warriors.<a id="FNanchor_339" href="#Footnote_339" class="fnanchor">339</a> If the number of gun-men
was four thousand, the number of guns in their possession
could scarcely be more than one thousand.
Not only had the Creeks few guns, and those in
poor condition, but they had little powder or lead,
and no means of repairing their weapons. Their
guns commonly missed fire, and even after discharging
them, the Creeks seldom reloaded, but resorted to
the bow-and-arrows which they always carried. As
warriors they felt their inferiority to the Shawanese
and Indians of the Lakes, while their position was
more desperate, for the Choctaws and Cherokees
behind them refused to join in their war.</p>

<p>Four thousand warriors who had never seen a
serious war even with their Indian neighbors, and
armed for the most part with clubs, or bows-and-arrows,
were not able to resist long the impact of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_234">234</span>
three or four armies, each nearly equal to their whole
force, coming from every quarter of the compass.
On the other hand, the military difficulties of conquering
the Creeks were not trifling. The same obstacles
that stopped Harrison in Ohio, stopped Pinckney in
Georgia. Pinckney, like Harrison, could set in motion
three columns of troops on three converging
lines, but he could not feed them or make roads
for them. The focus of Indian fanaticism was the
Hickory Ground at the fork of the Coosa and Tallapoosa,
about one hundred and fifty miles distant from
the nearest point that would furnish supplies for
an American army coming from Georgia, Tennessee,
or Mobile. Pinckney’s natural line of attack
was through Georgia to the Lower Creek towns and
the American forts on the Chattahoochee, whence he
could move along a good road about eighty miles to
the Upper Creek towns, near the Hickory Ground.
The next convenient line was from Mobile up the
Alabama River about one hundred and fifty miles to
the same point. The least convenient was the pathless,
mountainous, and barren region of Upper Alabama
and Georgia, through which an army from
Tennessee must toil for at least a hundred miles in
order to reach an enemy.</p>

<p>The State of Georgia was most interested in the
Creek war, and was chiefly to profit by it. Georgia
in 1813 had a white population of about one hundred
and twenty-five thousand, and a militia probably
numbering thirty thousand. Military District No. 6,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span>
embracing the two Carolinas and Georgia, was supposed
to contain two thousand regular troops, and
was commanded by Major-General Pinckney. Under
Pinckney’s command, a thousand regulars and three
thousand militia, advancing from Georgia by a good
road eighty miles into the Indian country, should have
been able to end the Creek war within six months
from the massacre at Fort Mims; but for some
reason the attempts on that side were not so successful
as they should have been, and were neither rapid
nor vigorous. Tennessee took the lead.</p>

<p>In respect of white population, the State of Tennessee
was more than double the size of Georgia; but
it possessed a greater advantage in Andrew Jackson,
whose extreme energy was equivalent to the addition
of an army. When news of the Mims massacre
reached Nashville about the middle of September,
Jackson was confined to his bed by a pistol-shot,
which had broken his arm and nearly cost his life
ten days before in a street brawl with Thomas H.
Benton. From his bed he issued an order calling
back into service his two thousand volunteers of 1812;
and as early as October 12, little more than a month
after the affair at Fort Mims, he and his army of
twenty-five hundred men were already camped on the
Tennessee River south of Huntsville in Alabama.
There was his necessary base of operations, but one
hundred and sixty miles of wilderness lay between
him and the Hickory Ground.</p>

<p>On the Tennessee River Jackson’s position bore<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
some resemblance to that of Harrison on the Maumee
a year before. Energy could not save him from failure.
Indeed, the greater his energy the more serious
were his difficulties. He depended on supplies from
east Tennessee descending the river; but the river
was low, and the supplies could not be moved. He
had taken no measures to procure supplies from
Nashville. Without food and forage he could not
safely advance, or even remain where he was. Under
such conditions, twenty-five hundred men with half
as many horses could not be kept together. Harrison
under the same difficulties held back his main
force near its magazines till it disbanded, without
approaching within a hundred miles of its object.
Jackson suffered nearly the same fate. He sent
away his mounted men under General Coffee to
forage on the banks of the Black Warrior River,
fifty miles to the southwest, where no Creeks were
to be feared. He forced his infantry forward through
rough country some twenty miles, to a point where
the river made its most southern bend, and there,
in the mountainous defile, he established, October 23,
a camp which he called Deposit, where his supplies
were to be brought when the river should permit.</p>

<p>Coffee’s mounted men returned October 24. Then,
October 25, in the hope of finding food as he went,
Jackson plunged into the mountains beyond the river,
intending to make a raid, as far as he could, into the
Creek country. Except fatigue and famine, he had
nothing to fear. The larger Creek towns were a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span>
hundred miles to the southward, and were busy
with threatened attacks nearer home. After a week’s
march Jackson reached the upper waters of the
Coosa. Within a short distance were two or three
small Creek villages. Against one of these Jackson
sent his mounted force, numbering nine hundred
men, under General Coffee. Early in the morning
of November 3, Coffee surrounded and destroyed
Talishatchee. His report represented that the Indians
made an obstinate resistance.<a id="FNanchor_340" href="#Footnote_340" class="fnanchor">340</a> “Not one of
the warriors escaped to tell the news,—a circumstance
unknown heretofore.” According to Coffee’s
estimate, Talishatchee contained two hundred and
eighty-four Indians of both sexes and all ages. If
one in three could be reckoned as capable of bearing
arms, the number of warriors was less than one
hundred. Coffee’s men after the battle counted one
hundred and eighty-six dead Indians, and estimated
the total loss at two hundred. In every attack on
an Indian village a certain number of women and
children were necessarily victims, but the proportion
at Talishatchee seemed large.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I lost five men killed, and forty-one wounded,” reported
Coffee,—“none mortally, the greater part slightly,
a number with arrows. Two of the men killed was with
arrows; this appears to form a very principal part of the
enemy’s arms for warfare, every man having a bow with
a bundle of arrows, which is used after the first fire with
the gun until a leisure time for loading offers.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_238">238</span></p>

<p>Meanwhile Jackson fortified a point on the Coosa,
about thirty-five miles from his base on the Tennessee,
and named it Fort Strother. There he expected
to be joined by a division of east Tennessee militia
under General Cocke, approaching from Chattanooga,
as he hoped, with supplies; but while waiting, he
received, November 7, a message from Talladega, a
Creek village thirty miles to the southward, reporting
that the town, which had refused to join the war-party,
was besieged and in danger of capture by a
large body of hostile warriors. Jackson instantly
started to save Talladega, and marched twenty-four
miles November 8, surrounding and attacking the
besieging Creeks the next morning.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The victory was very decisive,” reported Jackson to
Governor Blount,<a id="FNanchor_341" href="#Footnote_341" class="fnanchor">341</a> November 11; “two hundred and
ninety of the enemy were left dead, and there can be
no doubt but many more were killed who were not found....
In the engagement we lost fifteen killed, and eighty-five
wounded.”</p>
</div>

<p>Coffee estimated the number of Indians, on their
own report,<a id="FNanchor_342" href="#Footnote_342" class="fnanchor">342</a> at about one thousand. Jackson mentioned
no wounded Indians, nor the number of hostile
Creeks engaged. Male Indians, except infants, were
invariably killed, and probably not more than five or
six hundred were in the battle, for Coffee thought
very few escaped unhurt.</p>

<p>At Talladega Jackson was sixty miles from the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
Hickory Ground, and still nearer to several large
Indian towns, but he had already passed the limit of
his powers. News arrived that the army of eastern
Tennessee had turned eastward toward the Tallapoosa,
and that his expected supplies were as remote as
ever. Returning to Fort Strother November 10, Jackson
waited there in forced inactivity, as Harrison had
waited at Fort Meigs, anxious only to avoid the disgrace
of retreat. For two weeks the army had lived
on the Indians. A month more passed in idle starvation,
until after great efforts a supply train was organized,
and difficulties on that account ceased; but
at the same moment the army claimed discharge.</p>

<p>The claim was reasonable. Enlisted Dec. 10, 1812,
for one year, the men were entitled to their discharge
Dec. 10, 1813. Had Jackson been provided with
fresh levies he would doubtless have dismissed the
old; but in his actual situation their departure would
have left him at Fort Strother to pass the winter
alone. To prevent this, he insisted that the men had
no right to count as service, within the twelve months
for which they had enlisted, the months between May
and October when they were dismissed to their homes.
The men, unanimous in their own view of the contract,
started to march home December 10; and
Jackson, in a paroxysm of anger, planted two small
pieces of artillery in their path and threatened to fire
on them. The men, with good-temper, yielded for
the moment; and Jackson, quickly recognizing his
helplessness, gave way, and allowed them to depart<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
December 12, with a vehement appeal for volunteers
who made no response.</p>

<p>Fort Strother was then held for a short time by
east Tennessee militia, about fourteen hundred in
number, whose term of service was a few weeks
longer than that of the west Tennesseeans. Jackson
could do nothing with them, and remained idle.
The Governor of Tennessee advised him to withdraw
to the State frontier; but Jackson, while admitting
that his campaign had failed, declared that he would
perish before withdrawing from the ground he considered
himself to have gained.<a id="FNanchor_343" href="#Footnote_343" class="fnanchor">343</a> Fortunately he stood
in no danger. The Creeks did not molest him, and
he saw no enemy within fifty miles.</p>

<p>While Jackson was thus brought to a stand-still,
Major-General Cocke of east Tennessee, under greater
disadvantages, accomplished only results annoying to
Jackson. Cocke with twenty-five hundred three-months
militia took the field at Knoxville October
12, and moving by way of Chattanooga reached the
Coosa sixty or seventy miles above Camp Strother.
The nearest Creek Indians were the Hillabees, on
a branch of the Tallapoosa about sixty miles from
Cocke’s position, and the same distance from Jackson.
The Hillabees, a group of four small villages,
numbered in 1800 one hundred and seventy warriors.<a id="FNanchor_344" href="#Footnote_344" class="fnanchor">344</a>
Unaware that the Hillabees were making<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
their submission to Jackson, and were to receive his
promise of protection, Cocke sent a large detachment,
which started November 12 into the Indian country,
and surprised one of the Hillabee villages November
18, massacring sixty-one warriors, and capturing the
other inmates, two hundred and fifty in number,
without losing a drop of blood or meeting any
resistance.<a id="FNanchor_345" href="#Footnote_345" class="fnanchor">345</a></p>

<p>Jackson was already displeased with General
Cocke’s conduct, and the Hillabee massacre increased
his anger. Cocke had intentionally kept himself and
his army at a distance in order to maintain an independent
command.<a id="FNanchor_346" href="#Footnote_346" class="fnanchor">346</a> Not until Jackson’s troops disbanded
and marched home, December 12, did Cocke
come to Fort Strother. There his troops remained
a month, guarding Jackson’s camp, until January
12, 1814, when their three months’ term expired.</p>

<p>While five thousand men under Jackson and Cocke
wandered about northern Alabama, able to reach only
small and remote villages, none of which were actively
concerned in the outbreak, the Georgians organized
a force to enter the heart of the Creek
country. Brigadier-General John Floyd commanded
the Georgia army, and neither Major-General Pinckney
nor any United States troops belonged to it.
Jackson’s battle of Talladega was fought November
9; Cocke’s expedition against the Hillabees started<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span>
November 12, and surprised the Hillabee village November
18. Floyd entered the hostile country November
24. The Georgians though nearest were last
to move, and moved with the weakest force. Floyd
had but nine hundred and forty militia, and three
or four hundred friendly warriors of the Lower Creek
villages.</p>

<p>Floyd had heard that large numbers of hostile
Indians were assembled at Autossee,—a town on
the Tallapoosa River near Tuckaubatchee, in the
centre of the Upper Creek country. He crossed
the Chattahoochee November 24 with five days rations,
and marched directly against Autossee, arriving
within nine or ten miles without meeting resistance.
At half-past six on the morning of November
29 he formed his troops for action in front of the
town.<a id="FNanchor_347" href="#Footnote_347" class="fnanchor">347</a></p>

<p>The difference between the Northwestern Indians
and the Creeks was shown in the battle of Autossee
compared with Tippecanoe. Floyd was weaker
than Harrison, having only militia and Indians, while
Harrison had a regular regiment composing one third
of his rank-and-file. The Creeks were probably more
numerous than the Tippecanoe Indians, although in
both cases the numbers were quite unknown. Probably
the Creeks were less well armed, but they occupied
a strong position and stood on the defensive.
Floyd reported that by nine o’clock he drove the Indians
from their towns and burned their houses,—supposed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
to be four hundred in number. He estimated
their loss at two hundred killed. His own
loss was eleven killed and fifty-four wounded. That
of Harrison at Tippecanoe was sixty-one killed or
mortally wounded, and one hundred and twenty-seven
not fatally injured. The Creeks hardly inflicted
one fourth the loss caused by the followers
of the Shawnee Prophet.</p>

<p>General Floyd,—himself among the severely
wounded,—immediately after the battle ordered
the troops to begin their return march to the Chattahoochee.
The Georgia raid into the Indian country
was bolder, less costly, and more effective than
the Tennessee campaign; but at best it was only a
raid, like the Indian assault on Fort Mims, and offered
no immediate prospect of regular military occupation.
Another attempt, from a third quarter, had
the same unsatisfactory result.</p>

<p>The successor of General Wilkinson at New Orleans
and Mobile, and in Military District No. 7,
was Brigadier-General Thomas Flournoy. Under
his direction an expedition was organized from Fort
Stoddert, commanded by Brigadier-General Claiborne
of the Mississippi volunteers. Claiborne was given
the Third United States Infantry, with a number of
militia, volunteers, and Choctaw Indians,—in all
about a thousand men. He first marched to a point
on the Alabama River, about eighty-five miles above
Fort Stoddert, where he constructed a military post,
called Fort Claiborne. Having established his base<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>
there, he marched, December 13, up the river till he
reached, December 23, the Holy Ground, where the
half-breed Weatherford lived. There Claiborne approached
within about fifty miles of the point which
Floyd reached a month before, but for want of co-operation
he could not maintain his advantage. He
attacked and captured Weatherford’s town, killing
thirty Indians, with a loss of one man; but after
destroying the place he retreated, arriving unharmed
at Fort Claiborne, on the last day of the year.</p>

<p>Thus the year 1813 ended without closing the
Creek war. More than seven thousand men had
entered the Indian country from four directions; and
with a loss of thirty or forty lives had killed, according
to their reports, about eight hundred Indians, or
one fifth of the hostile Creek warriors; but this carnage
had fallen chiefly on towns and villages not
responsible for the revolt. The true fanatics were
little harmed, and could offer nearly as much resistance
as ever. The failure and excessive expense of
the campaign were the more annoying, because they
seemed beyond proportion to the military strength of
the fanatics. Major-General Pinckney wrote to the
War Department at the close of the <span class="locked">year:<a id="FNanchor_348" href="#Footnote_348" class="fnanchor">348</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The force of the hostile Creeks was estimated by the
best judges to have consisted of three thousand five hundred
warriors; of these it is apprehended that about one
thousand have been put <i lang="fr">hors de combat</i>.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_245">245</span></p>

<p>To Andrew Jackson, Pinckney wrote, Jan. 19, 1814,<a id="FNanchor_349" href="#Footnote_349" class="fnanchor">349</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Your letter, dated December 26, did not reach me
until the last evening. Your preceding dispatches of
December 14 had led me to conclude what would probably
soon be the diminished state of your force. I
therefore immediately ordered to your support Colonel
Williams’s regiment of twelve-months men, and wrote
to the Governor of Tennessee urging him to complete
the requisition of fifteen hundred for the time authorized
by law. I learn from the person who brought your
letter that Colonel Williams’s regiment is marching to
join you; if the fifteen hundred of the quota should also
be furnished by Governor Blount, you will in my opinion
have force sufficient for the object to be attained. The
largest computation that I have heard of the hostile
Creek warriors, made by any competent judge, is four
thousand. At least one thousand of them have been
killed or disabled; they are badly armed and supplied
with ammunition; little doubt can exist that two thousand
of our men would be infinitely superior to any
number they can collect.”</p>

east Tennesseeans, January 14, received a reinforcement
of sixty-day militia, barely nine hundred in
number.<a id="FNanchor_350" href="#Footnote_350" class="fnanchor">350</a> Determined to use them to the utmost,
Jackson started three days afterward to co-operate
with General Floyd in an attack on the Tallapoosa
villages, aiming at a town called Emuckfaw, some
forty miles north of Tuckaubatchee. The movement<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>
was much more dangerous than any he had
yet attempted. His own force was fresh, motley,
and weak, numbering only nine hundred and thirty
militia, including “a company of volunteer officers
headed by General Coffee, who had been abandoned
by his men,” and assisted by two or three hundred
friendly Creeks and Cherokees. The sixty-day militia
were insubordinate and unsteady, the march was
long, and the Creek towns at which he aimed were
relatively large. Emuckfaw was one of seven villages
belonging to Ocfuskee, the largest town in the Creek
nation,—in 1800 supposed to contain four hundred
and fifty warriors.<a id="FNanchor_351" href="#Footnote_351" class="fnanchor">351</a></p>

<p>As far as Enotachopco Creek, twelve miles from
Emuckfaw, Jackson had no great danger to fear;
but beyond that point he marched with caution. At
daylight, January 22, the Indians, who were strongly
encamped at about three miles distance, made an
attack on Jackson’s camp, which was repulsed after
half an hour’s fighting. Jackson then sent Coffee
with four hundred men to burn the Indian camp, but
Coffee returned without attempting it. “On viewing
the encampment and its strength the General
thought it most prudent to return to my encampment,”
reported Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_352" href="#Footnote_352" class="fnanchor">352</a> Immediately after Coffee’s
return the Indians again attacked, and Coffee sallied
out to turn their flank, followed by not more than
fifty-four men. The Indians were again repulsed with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
a loss of forty-five killed, but Coffee was severely
wounded, and Jackson “determined to commence a
return march to Fort Strother the following day.”</p>

<p>At that moment Jackson’s situation was not unlike
that of Harrison after the battle of Tippecanoe,
and he escaped less happily. Fortifying his camp,
he remained during the night of January 22 undisturbed.
At half-past ten, January 23, he began his
return march, “and was fortunate enough to reach
Enotachopco before night, having passed without interruption
a dangerous defile occasioned by a hurricane.”<a id="FNanchor_353" href="#Footnote_353" class="fnanchor">353</a>
Enotachopco Creek was twelve or fifteen
miles from Emuckfaw Creek, and the Hillabee towns
were about the same distance beyond.</p>

<p>At Enotachopco Jackson again fortified his camp.
His position was such as required the utmost caution
in remaining or moving. So hazardous was the passage
of the deep creek and the defile beyond, through
which the army had marched in its advance, that
Jackson did not venture to return by the same path,
but on the morning of January 24 began cautiously
crossing the creek at a safer <span class="locked">point:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The front guard had crossed with part of the flank
columns, the wounded were over, and the artillery in the
act of entering the creek, when an alarm-gun was heard
in the woods.... To my astonishment and mortification,
when the word was given by Colonel Carrol to halt
and form, and a few guns had been fired, I beheld the
right and left columns of the rear guard precipitately<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span>
give way. This shameful retreat was disastrous in the
extreme; it drew along with it the greater part of the
centre column, leaving not more than twenty-five men,
who being formed by Colonel Carrol maintained their
ground as long as it was possible to maintain it, and it
brought consternation and confusion into the centre of
the army,—a consternation which was not easily removed,
and a confusion which could not soon be restored
to order.”<a id="FNanchor_354" href="#Footnote_354" class="fnanchor">354</a></p>
</div>

<p>The Indians were either weak or ignorant of warfare,
for they failed to take advantage of the panic,
and allowed themselves to be driven away by a handful
of men. Jackson’s troops escaped unharmed, or
but little injured, their loss in the engagements of
January 22 and 24 being twenty-four men killed and
seventy-one wounded. Probably the Creek force consisted
of the Ocfuskee warriors, and numbered about
half that of Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_355" href="#Footnote_355" class="fnanchor">355</a> Coffee supposed them to be
eight hundred or a thousand in number, but the exaggeration
in estimating Indian forces was always
greater than in estimating white enemies in battle.
An allowance of one third was commonly needed for
exaggeration in reported numbers of European combatants;
an allowance of one half was not unreasonable
in estimates of Indian forces.</p>

<p>In letting Jackson escape from Emuckfaw the
Creeks lost their single opportunity. Jackson never
repeated the experiment. He arrived at Fort Strother<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span>
in safety January 29, and did not again leave his
intrenchment until the middle of March, under much
better conditions.</p>

<p>General Floyd was no more successful. Jackson
started from Fort Strother for Emuckfaw January 17;
Floyd left Fort Mitchell, on the Chattahoochee, January
18, for Tuckaubatchee, only forty miles south
of Emuckfaw.<a id="FNanchor_356" href="#Footnote_356" class="fnanchor">356</a> Floyd’s army, like Jackson’s, was
partly composed of militia and partly of Lower Creek
warriors, in all about seventeen hundred men, including
four hundred friendly Creeks. From the best
information to be obtained at the time, the effective
strength of the hostile Indians did not then exceed
two thousand warriors,<a id="FNanchor_357" href="#Footnote_357" class="fnanchor">357</a> scattered along the Coosa
and Tallapoosa rivers; while experience proved the
difficulty of concentrating large bodies of Indians,
even when supplies were furnished them. The British
commissariat in Canada constantly issued from five
to ten thousand rations for Indians and their families,
but Proctor never brought more than fifteen hundred
warriors into battle. The Creeks, as far as was
known, never numbered a thousand warriors in any
battle during the war. Floyd, with seventeen hundred
men well armed, was able to face the whole
Creek nation, and meant to move forward, fortifying
military posts at each day’s march, until he should
establish himself on the Tallapoosa in the centre<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span>
of the Creek towns, and wait for a junction with
Jackson.</p>

<p>When Jackson was repulsed at Emuckfaw January
22, Floyd was about forty miles to the southward,
expecting to draw the chief attack of the
Indians. Having advanced forty-eight miles from
the Chattahoochee he arrived at a point about seven
or eight miles south of Tuckaubatchee, where he fortified,
on Calibee Creek, a camp called Defiance.
There, before daybreak on the morning of January 27,
he was sharply attacked, as Harrison was attacked
at Tippecanoe, and with the same result. The attack
was repulsed, but Floyd lost twenty-two killed and
one hundred and forty-seven wounded,—the largest
number of casualties that had yet occurred in the
Indian war. The Indians “left thirty-seven dead on
the field; from the effusion of blood and the number
of head-dresses and war-clubs found in various
directions, their loss must have been considerable
independent of their wounded.”<a id="FNanchor_358" href="#Footnote_358" class="fnanchor">358</a></p>

<p>The battle of Calibee Creek, January 27, was in
substance a defeat to Floyd. So decided were his
militia in their determination to go home, that he
abandoned all his fortified posts and fell back to the
Chattahoochee, where he arrived February 1, four days
after the battle.<a id="FNanchor_359" href="#Footnote_359" class="fnanchor">359</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span></p>

<p>Six months had then elapsed since the outbreak of
hostilities at Burnt Corn; a year since the Little
Warrior murders on the Ohio River, yet not a post
had been permanently occupied within eighty miles
of the fanatical centre at the fork of the Coosa and
Tallapoosa.</p>

<p>Pinckney was obliged to apply to the governors of
North and South Carolina to furnish him with men
and equipments. The Governor of Georgia also exerted
himself to supply the deficiencies of the national
magazines.<a id="FNanchor_360" href="#Footnote_360" class="fnanchor">360</a> By their aid Pinckney was able to collect
an army with which to make another and a decisive
movement into the Creek country: but before he
could act, Jackson succeeded in striking a final blow.</p>

<p>Jackson’s success in overcoming the obstacles in
his path was due to his obstinacy in insisting on
maintaining himself at Fort Strother, which obliged
Governor Blount to order out four thousand more
militia in January for six months. Perhaps this
force alone would have been no more effectual in
1814 than in 1813, but another reinforcement was
decisive. The Thirty-ninth regiment of the regular
army, authorized by the Act of January 29, 1813, had
been officered and recruited in Tennessee, and was
still in the State. Major-General Pinckney sent orders,
Dec. 23, 1813, to its colonel, John Williams, to
join Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_361" href="#Footnote_361" class="fnanchor">361</a> The arrival of the Thirty-ninth regiment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_252">252</span>
February 6, 1814, gave Jackson the means of
coping with his militia. February 21 he wrote to
his quartermaster, Major Lewis, that he meant to use
his regulars first to discipline his own army.<a id="FNanchor_362" href="#Footnote_362" class="fnanchor">362</a> “I
am truly happy in having the Colonel [Williams]
with me. His regiment will give strength to my
arm, and quell mutiny.” His patience with militia-men
had been long exhausted, and he meant to
make a warning of the next mutineer.</p>

<p>The first victim was no less a person than Major-General
Cocke of the east Tennessee militia. Cocke’s
division of two thousand men, mustered for six
months, began January 17 its march from Knoxville
to Fort Strother.<a id="FNanchor_363" href="#Footnote_363" class="fnanchor">363</a> Learning on the march that the
west Tennessee division, mustered at the same time
for the same service, had been accepted to serve only
three months, Cocke’s men mutinied, and Cocke tried
to pacify them by a friendly speech. Jackson, learning
what had passed, despatched a sharp order to one
of Cocke’s brigadiers to arrest and send under guard
to Fort Strother every officer of whatever rank who
should be found exciting the men to mutiny. Cocke
was put under arrest when almost in sight of the
enemy’s country; his sword was taken from him,
and he was sent to Nashville for trial.<a id="FNanchor_364" href="#Footnote_364" class="fnanchor">364</a> His division
came to Fort Strother, and said no more about
its term of service.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span></p>

<p>Having dealt thus with the officers, Jackson selected
at leisure a test of strength with the men.
The conduct of the Fayetteville company of the
Twenty-eighth regiment of west Tennessee light infantry
gave him ground for displeasure. Not only
had they refused to obey the call for six months’ service
and insisted on serving for three months or not
at all, but they had halted on their march, and had
sent their commanding officer to bargain with Jackson
for his express adhesion to their terms. Learning
that Jackson made difficulties, they marched home
without waiting for an official reply. Jackson ordered
the whole body to be arrested as deserters, accompanying
his order by an offer of pardon to such as
returned to duty on their own understanding of the
term of service. The company was again mustered,
and arrived at Fort Strother not long after the arrival
of the Thirty-ninth United States Infantry.</p>

<p>A few weeks later an unfortunate private of the
same company, named Woods, refused to obey the
officer of the day, and threatened to shoot any man
who arrested him. Jackson instantly called a court-martial,
tried and sentenced Woods, and March 14
caused him to be shot. The execution was a harsh
measure; but Jackson gave to it a peculiar character
by issuing a general order in which he misstated facts
that made Wood’s case exceptional,<a id="FNanchor_365" href="#Footnote_365" class="fnanchor">365</a> in order to let
the company understand that their comrade was suffering
the penalty which they all deserved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>

<p>Without giving his army time to brood over this
severity, Jackson ordered a general movement, and
within forty-eight hours after Woods’s execution, all
were well on their way toward the enemy. Jackson
had with him about five thousand men, four fifths of
whom expected their discharge in a month. He left
them not a day’s repose.</p>

<p>Two lines of advance were open to him in approaching
the fork of the Coosa and Tallapoosa,
which was always the objective point. He might
descend the Coosa, or cross to the Tallapoosa by the
way he had taken in January. He descended the
Coosa thirty miles, and then struck a sudden blow at
the Tallapoosa towns.</p>

<p>The Ocfuskee Indians, elated by their success in
January, collected their whole force, with that of
some neighboring towns, in a bend of the Tallapoosa,
where they built a sort of fortress by constructing
across the neck of the Horse-shoe a breastwork composed
of five large logs, one above the other, with
two ranges of port-holes.<a id="FNanchor_366" href="#Footnote_366" class="fnanchor">366</a> The interior was covered
with trees and fallen timber along the river side,
and caves were dug in the bank. Seven or eight
hundred Indian warriors together with many women
and children were within the enclosure of eighty or a
hundred acres.</p>

<p>Jackson, after leaving a garrison at a new fort
which he constructed on the Coosa, about half way<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
to the Horse-shoe, had somewhat less than three
thousand effectives.<a id="FNanchor_367" href="#Footnote_367" class="fnanchor">367</a> With these he camped, on the
evening of March 28, about six miles northwest of
the bend, and the next morning advanced to attack
it. “Determined to exterminate them,” he reported,<a id="FNanchor_368" href="#Footnote_368" class="fnanchor">368</a>
he detached Coffee with the mounted force
of seven hundred men and six hundred friendly
Indians<a id="FNanchor_369" href="#Footnote_369" class="fnanchor">369</a> to surround the bend, along the river bank,
while Jackson himself with all his infantry took
position before the breastwork. At half-past ten
o’clock he planted his cannon about two hundred
yards<a id="FNanchor_370" href="#Footnote_370" class="fnanchor">370</a> from the centre of the work, and began a
rapid fire of artillery and musketry, which continued
for two hours without producing apparent effect.
Meanwhile the Cherokee allies swam the river in the
rear of the Creek warriors, who were all at the breastwork,
and seizing canoes, brought some two hundred
Indians and whites into the Horse-shoe, where they
climbed the high ground in the rear of the breastwork
and fired on the Creeks, who were occupied in
defending their front.</p>

<p>Jackson then ordered an assault on the breastwork,
which was carried, with considerable loss,
by the Thirty-ninth regiment, in the centre. The
Creeks sought shelter in the thickets and under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span>
the bluffs, where they were hunted or burned out,
and killed. “The slaughter was greater than all
we had done before,” wrote Coffee; it was continued
all day and the next morning. When the
Horse-shoe had been thoroughly cleared, five hundred
and fifty-seven dead bodies were counted within
the bend; many were killed in the river, and about
twenty were supposed to have escaped. According
to Coffee, “we killed not less than eight hundred
and fifty or nine hundred of them, and took about
five hundred squaws and children prisoners.” The
proportion of squaws and children to the whole number
of Indians showed the probable proportion of
warriors among the dead. “I lament that two or
three women and children were killed by accident,”
reported Jackson.<a id="FNanchor_371" href="#Footnote_371" class="fnanchor">371</a></p>

<p>Jackson’s loss was chiefly confined to the Thirty-ninth
regiment and the friendly Indians, who were
most actively engaged in the storm. The Thirty-ninth
lost twenty killed and fifty-two wounded. Among the
severely wounded was Ensign Samuel Houston, struck
by an arrow in the thigh. The major and two lieutenants
were killed. The Cherokees lost eighteen
killed and thirty-five wounded. The friendly Creeks
lost five killed and eleven wounded. The Tennessee
militia, comprising two thirds of the army, lost only
eight killed and fifty-two wounded. The total loss
was fifty-one killed and one hundred and forty-eight
wounded.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_257">257</span></p>

<p>Jackson’s policy of extermination shocked many
humane Americans, and would perhaps have seemed
less repulsive had the Creeks shown more capacity
for resistance. The proportion between two hundred
casualties on one side and seven or eight hundred
killed on the other would have been striking in any
case, but was especially so where the advantages of
position were on the side of the defence. A more
serious criticism was that the towns thus exterminated
were not the towns chiefly responsible for the
outbreak. The Alabamas and the main body of
fanatical Creeks escaped.</p>

<p>Jackson was obliged to return to his new fort on
the Coosa, a march of five days; and was delayed
five days more by preparations to descend the river.
When at length he moved southward, scouring the
country as he went, he could find no more enemies.
He effected his junction with the Georgia troops
April 15, and the united armies reached the fork
of the Coosa and Tallapoosa April 18, where Major-General
Pinckney joined them, April 20, and took
command;<a id="FNanchor_372" href="#Footnote_372" class="fnanchor">372</a> but the Red Sticks had then fled southward.
A few of the hostile leaders, including Weatherford,
made submission, but McQueen and the chief
prophets escaped to continue the war from Florida.
The friendly Creeks did not consider the war to be
finished; they reported to <span class="locked">Hawkins<a id="FNanchor_373" href="#Footnote_373" class="fnanchor">373</a>—</span></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They did not believe the hostile Indians were ready
for peace, although a part of them had suffered so severely
in battle against our armies. They were proud,
haughty, brave, and mad by fanaticism. Those of the
towns of Tallapoosa below Tuckaubatchee and Alabama
had suffered the least, although they were the most culpable;
and it was probable they would mistake our object
in offering terms of peace to them.”</p>
</div>

<p>The number of refugees was never precisely known,
but Hawkins reported that eight of the Tallapoosa
towns had migrated in a body to Spanish territory,<a id="FNanchor_374" href="#Footnote_374" class="fnanchor">374</a>
and probably a larger proportion of the Coosa and
Alabama towns accompanied them. The Indians
themselves gave out that a few more than a thousand
Red Stick warriors survived, who meant to die fighting.
In May the British admiral Cochrane sent Captain
Pigot of the “Orpheus” to the Appalachicola to
communicate with the refugee Creek Indians and supply
them with arms. Pigot received ten of the principal
chiefs on board his vessel May 20, and reported<a id="FNanchor_375" href="#Footnote_375" class="fnanchor">375</a>
on their authority that “the number of the warriors
of the Creek Nation friendly to the English and
ready to take up arms was about twenty-eight hundred,
exclusive of one thousand unarmed warriors
who had been driven by the Americans from their
towns into the marshes near Pensacola, and who
were expected to rejoin the main body.” The Creek<span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span>
warriors friendly to the Americans were estimated
at about twelve hundred, and the fugitive Red Sticks
at one thousand. Whatever their number, they included
the most fanatical followers of Tecumthe, and
their obstinate outlawry caused long and costly difficulties
to the United States government.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the whites were conquerors and could
take as much of the Creek lands as suited them; but
an irregularity of form could not be avoided. Secretary
Armstrong first authorized General Pinckney
to conclude a treaty of peace with the hostile Creeks,
containing a cession of land and other provisions.<a id="FNanchor_376" href="#Footnote_376" class="fnanchor">376</a>
A few days later Armstrong saw reason to prefer
that the proposed treaty with the Creeks should take
a form altogether military, and be in the nature
of a capitulation.<a id="FNanchor_377" href="#Footnote_377" class="fnanchor">377</a> His idea required a treaty with
the hostile Creek chiefs;<a id="FNanchor_378" href="#Footnote_378" class="fnanchor">378</a> but the hostile Creeks
were not a separate organization capable of making
a treaty or granting lands of the Creek nation; and
besides that difficulty the hostile chiefs had fled, and
refused either to submit or negotiate. No chiefs remained
except among the friendly Creeks, who could
not capitulate because they had never been at war.
They had fought in the United States service and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
were entitled to reward as allies, not to punishment
as enemies.</p>

<p>The solution of this legal problem was entrusted to
Andrew Jackson, whose services in the war earned
for him the appointment of major-general in the
regular army, and the command of Military District
No. 7, with headquarters at Mobile. Jackson met the
Creek chiefs in July. The Indians, parties to the
negotiation, were friendly chiefs, deputies, and warriors,
representing perhaps one third of the entire
Creek nation. To these allies and friends Jackson
presented a paper, originally intended for the hostile
Indians, entitled “Articles of Agreement and
Capitulation,” requiring as indemnity for war expenses
a surrender of two thirds of their territory.
They were required to withdraw from the southern
and western half of Alabama, within the Chattahoochee
on the east and the Coosa on the west. The
military object of this policy was to isolate them from
the Seminoles and Spaniards on one side, and from
the Choctaws and Chickasaws on the other. The
political object was to surround them with a white
population.</p>

<p>Unanimously the Creeks refused to accept the
sacrifice. Jackson told them in reply that their refusal
would show them to be enemies of the United
States; that they might retain their own part of the
country, but that the part which belonged to the hostile
Indians would be taken by the government; and
that the chiefs who would not consent to sign the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span>
paper might join the Red Sticks at Pensacola,—although,
added Jackson, he should probably overtake
and destroy them before they could get there. Such
arguments could not be answered. A number of the
Creeks at last, after long resistance, signed the capitulation
or agreement, although they continued to protest
against it, and refused their aid to carry it out.</p>

<p>Jackson’s capitulation of Aug. 9, 1814,<a id="FNanchor_379" href="#Footnote_379" class="fnanchor">379</a> which,
without closing the Creek war, appropriated to the
government the larger part of the Creek lands, was
nearly simultaneous with a treaty<a id="FNanchor_380" href="#Footnote_380" class="fnanchor">380</a> signed July 22
by William Henry Harrison and Lewis Cass, at
Greenville in Ohio, with chiefs of the Wyandots,
Delawares, Shawanese, Senecas, and Miamis. This
treaty contained no land-cession, but established
peace between the parties, and obliged the Indian
signers to declare war on the British. Neither Harrison’s
nor Jackson’s treaty embraced the chief body
of hostile Indians; but Harrison’s treaty served another
purpose of no small value in appearing to
remove an obstacle to negotiation with England.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">Badly</span> as the United States fared in the campaign
of 1813, their situation would have been easy had
they not suffered under the annoyances of a blockade
continually becoming more stringent. The doctrine
that coasts could be blockaded was enforced
against America with an energy that fell little short
of demonstration. The summer was well advanced
before the whole naval force to be used for the purpose
could be posted at the proper stations. Not
until May 26 did Admiral Warren issue at Bermuda
his proclamation of “a strict and rigorous blockade
of the ports and harbors of New York, Charleston,
Port Royal, Savannah, and of the river Mississippi,”
which completed the blockade of the coast, leaving
only the ports of New England open to neutrals.
From that time nothing entered or left the blockaded
coast except swift privateers, or occasional fast-sailing
vessels which risked capture in the attempt.
Toward the close of the year Admiral Warren extended
his blockade eastward. Notice of the extension
was given at Halifax November 16, and by the
blockading squadron off New London December 2,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span>
thus closing Long Island Sound to all vessels of
every description.<a id="FNanchor_381" href="#Footnote_381" class="fnanchor">381</a></p>

<p>The pressure of the blockade was immediately
felt. In August<a id="FNanchor_382" href="#Footnote_382" class="fnanchor">382</a> superfine flour sold at Boston for
$11.87 a barrel, at Baltimore for $6.00, and at
Richmond for $4.50. Upland cotton sold at Boston
for twenty cents a pound; at Charleston for nine
cents. Rice sold at Philadelphia for $12.00 a hundred
weight; in Charleston and Savannah for $3.00.
Sugar sold in Boston for $18.75 a hundred weight;
in Baltimore for $26.50. Already the American
staples were unsalable at the places of their production.
No rate of profit could cause cotton, rice, or
wheat to be brought by sea from Charleston or Norfolk
to Boston. Soon speculation began. The price
of imported articles rose to extravagant points. At
the end of the year coffee sold for thirty-eight cents
a pound, after selling for twenty-one cents in August.
Tea which could be bought for $1.70 per pound in
August, sold for three and four dollars in December.
Sugar which was quoted at nine dollars a hundred
weight in New Orleans, and in August sold for
twenty-one or twenty-two dollars in New York and
Philadelphia, stood at forty dollars in December.</p>

<p>More sweeping in its effects on exports than on
imports, the blockade rapidly reduced the means of
the people. After the summer of 1813, Georgia
alone, owing to its contiguity with Florida, succeeded<span class="pagenum" id="Page_264">264</span>
in continuing to send out cotton. The exports of
New York, which exceeded $12,250,000 in 1811, fell
to $209,000 for the year ending in 1814. The domestic
exports of Virginia diminished in four years
from $4,800,000 to $3,000,000 for 1812, $1,819,000
for 1813, and $17,581 for the year ending Sept. 30,
1814. At the close of 1813 exports, except from
Georgia and New England, ceased.<a id="FNanchor_383" href="#Footnote_383" class="fnanchor">383</a></p>

<p>On the revenue the blockade acted with equal
effect. Owing to the increase of duties and to
open ports, the New England States rather increased
than diminished their customs receipts. Until the
summer of 1813, when the blockade began in earnest,
New York showed the same result; but after
that time the receipts fell, until they averaged less
than $50,000 a month instead of $500,000, which
would have been a normal average if peace had been
preserved. Philadelphia suffered sooner. In 1810
the State of Pennsylvania contributed more than
$200,000 a month to the Treasury; in 1813 it contributed
about $25,000 a month. Maryland, where
was collected in 1812 no less than $1,780,000 of net
revenue, paid only $182,000 in 1813, and showed an
actual excess of expenditures in 1814. After the
summer, the total net revenue collected in every
port of the United States outside of New England
did not exceed $150,000 a month, or at the rate of
$1,800,000 a year.<a id="FNanchor_384" href="#Footnote_384" class="fnanchor">384</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span></p>

<p>No ordinary operations of war could affect the
United States so severely as this inexorable blockade.
Every citizen felt it in every action of his life.
The farmer grew crops which he could not sell,
while he paid tenfold prices for every necessity.
While the country was bursting with wealth, it was
ruined. The blockade was but a part of the evil.
The whole coast was systematically swept of the
means of industry. Especially the Virginians and
Marylanders felt the heavy hand of England as it
was felt nowhere else except on the Niagara River.
A large British squadron occupied Chesapeake Bay,
and converted it into a British naval station. After
the month of February, 1813, the coasts of Virginia
and Maryland enjoyed not a moment’s repose. Considering
the immense naval power wielded by England,
the Americans were fortunate that their chief
losses were confined to the farm-yards and poultry
of a few islands in Chesapeake Bay, but the constant
annoyance and terror were not the less painful to
the people who apprehended attack.</p>

<p>Fortunately the British naval officers showed little
disposition to distinguish themselves, and their huge
line-of-battle ships were not adapted to river service.
The squadron under the general command of Admiral
Sir John Borlase Warren seemed contented for
the most part to close the bay to commerce. The
only officer in the fleet who proved the energy and
capacity to use a part of the great force lying idle
at Lynnhaven Bay was Rear-Admiral Sir George<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
Cockburn, whose efficiency was attested by the execration
in which his name was held for fifty years in
the United States. His duties were not of a nature
to make him popular, and he was an admiral of the
old school, whose boisterous energy seemed to take
needless pleasure in the work.</p>

<p>Early in April, 1813, Admiral Warren sent Cockburn
with a light flotilla to the head of Chesapeake
Bay to destroy everything that could serve a warlike
purpose, and to interrupt, as far as possible, communication
along the shore.<a id="FNanchor_385" href="#Footnote_385" class="fnanchor">385</a> The squadron consisted
of only one light frigate, the “Maidstone,” thirty-six
guns; two brigs, the “Fantome” and “Mohawk;”
and three or four prize schooners, with four or five
hundred seamen, marines, and soldiers. With this
petty force Cockburn stationed himself at the mouth
of the Susquehanna River, and soon threw Maryland
into paroxysms of alarm and anger. Taking
possession of the islands in his neighborhood, he
obtained supplies of fresh food for the whole British
force in Chesapeake Bay. He then scoured every
creek and inlet above his anchorage. He first moved
into the Elk River, and sent his boats, April 28, with
one hundred and fifty marines, to Frenchtown,—a
village of a dozen buildings, which had acquired a
certain importance for the traffic between Baltimore
and Philadelphia since the stoppage of transit by
sea. Without losing a man, the expedition drove<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
away the few Americans who made a show of resistance,
and burned whatever property was found,
“consisting of much flour, a large quantity of army
clothing, of saddles, bridles, and other equipments
for cavalry, etc., together with various articles of merchandise,”
besides five vessels lying near the place.<a id="FNanchor_386" href="#Footnote_386" class="fnanchor">386</a></p>

<p>Cockburn next sent the same force to destroy a
battery lately erected at Havre de Grace. The attack
was made on the morning of May 3, and like
the attack on Frenchtown, met with only resistance
enough to offer an excuse for pillage. The militia
took refuge in the woods; Cockburn’s troops destroyed
or carried away the arms and cannon, and
set fire to the town of some sixty houses, “to cause
the proprietors (who had deserted them and formed
part of the militia who had fled to the woods) to
understand and feel what they were liable to bring
upon themselves by building batteries and acting
toward us with so much useless rancor.”<a id="FNanchor_387" href="#Footnote_387" class="fnanchor">387</a> While
engaged in this work Cockburn was told that an
extensive cannon-foundry existed about four miles
up the Susquehanna River; and he immediately
started for it in his boats. He met no resistance,
and destroyed the foundry with several small vessels.
His handful of men passed the day undisturbed
on the banks of the Susquehanna, capturing
fifty-one cannon, mostly heavy pieces, with one hundred<span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span>
and thirty stand of small arms. The party
then returned to their ships, “where we arrived at
ten o’clock, after being twenty-two hours in constant
exertion, without nourishment of any kind; and I
have much pleasure in being able to add that, excepting
Lieutenant Westphall’s wound, we have not
suffered any casualty whatever.”</p>

<p>These expeditions cleared every inlet in the Upper
Chesapeake except the Sassafras River on the eastern
shore. During the night of May 5 Cockburn
sent his boats into the Sassafras. Militia in considerable
numbers assembled on both banks and opened
a fire which Cockburn described as “most heavy,”
aided by one long gun. Cockburn landed, dispersed
the militia, and destroyed Fredericktown and Georgetown,
with the vessels and stores he found there.
This expedition cost him five men wounded, one
severely. The next day, May 6, he reported to
Admiral <span class="locked">Warren,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I had a deputation from Charleston in the Northeast
River to assure me that that place is considered by
them at your mercy, and that neither guns nor militia-men
shall be suffered there; and as I am assured that all the
places in the upper part of Chesapeake Bay have adopted
similar resolutions, and as there is now neither public
property, vessels, nor warlike stores remaining in this
neighborhood, I propose returning to you with the light
squadron to-morrow morning.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus in the course of a week, and without loss of
life on either side, Cockburn with a few boats and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
one hundred and fifty men terrorized the shores of
the Upper Chesapeake, and by his loud talk and random
threats threw even Baltimore into a panic, causing
every one to suspend other pursuits in order to
garrison the city against an imaginary attack. The
people, harassed by this warfare, remembered with
extreme bitterness the marauding of Cockburn and
his sailors; but where he met no resistance he paid
in part for what private property he took, and as
far as was recorded, his predatory excursions cost the
Marylanders not a wound.</p>

<p>For six weeks after Cockburn’s return to Warren’s
station at Lynnhaven Bay, the British fleet remained
inactive. Apparently the British government aimed
at no greater object than that of clearing from
Chesapeake Bay every vessel not engaged in British
interests under British protection. The small craft
and privateers were quickly taken or destroyed; but
the three chief depots of commerce and armaments—Norfolk,
Baltimore, and Washington—required a
greater effort. Of these three places Norfolk seemed
most open to approach, and Admiral Warren determined
to attack it.</p>

<p>The British navy wished nothing more ardently
than to capture or destroy the American frigates.
One of these, the “Constellation,” lay at Norfolk,
where it remained blockaded throughout the war.
Admiral Warren could earn no distinction so great
as the credit of capturing this frigate, which not only
threatened to annoy British commerce should she<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
escape to sea, but even when blockaded in port required
a considerable squadron to watch her, and
neutralized several times her force.</p>

<p>Another annoyance drew Warren’s attention to
Norfolk. June 20, fifteen gunboats issued from the
harbor before daylight, and under cover of darkness
approached within easy range of a becalmed British
frigate, the “Junon” of forty-six guns. For half an
hour, from four o’clock till half-past four, the gunboats
maintained, according to the official report of
Commodore Cassin who commanded them, “a heavy,
galling fire at about three quarters of a mile distance.”<a id="FNanchor_388" href="#Footnote_388" class="fnanchor">388</a>
Their armament was not mentioned, but
probably they, like the gunboats on the Lakes, carried
in part long thirty-two and twenty-four-pound
guns. The attack was intended to test the offensive
value of gunboats, and the result was not satisfactory.
The fire of fifteen heavy guns for half an hour on
a defenceless frigate within easy range should have
caused great injury, but did not. When a breeze
rose and enabled the “Junon” and a neighboring
frigate, the “Barrosa,” to get under weigh, the gunboats
were obliged to retire with the loss of one
man killed and two wounded. The “Junon” also
had one man killed, but received only one or two
shots in her hull.<a id="FNanchor_389" href="#Footnote_389" class="fnanchor">389</a></p>

<p>The “Constellation” lay, under the guns of two forts
and with every possible precaution, five miles up the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_271">271</span>
Elizabeth River, at the Portsmouth navy-yard. The
utmost pains had been taken to provide against approach
by water. Whatever incompetence or neglect
was shown elsewhere, Norfolk was under the command
of able officers in both services, who neglected
no means of defence. General Wade Hampton had
fortified the interior line immediately below the town,
where two strong forts were constructed under the
direction of Captain Walker Keith Armistead of the
Engineers, the first graduate of the West Point Academy
in 1803. Five miles below these forts, where
the river widened into Hampton Roads, Brigadier-General
Robert Taylor of the Virginia militia, and
Captain John Cassin commanding at the navy-yard,
established a second line of defence, resting on Craney
Island on the left, supported by fifteen or twenty gunboats
moored across the channel. A battery of seven
guns was established on the island covering the approach
to the gunboats, so that the capture of the
island was necessary to the approach by water. The
force on the island consisted of about seven hundred
men, of whom less than a hundred were State troops.
The rest were infantry of the line, riflemen, seamen,
and marines.<a id="FNanchor_390" href="#Footnote_390" class="fnanchor">390</a> The town and forts were strongly garrisoned,
and a large body of State militia was constantly
on service.</p>

<p>To deal with the defences of Norfolk, Admiral
Warren brought from Bermuda, according to newspaper
account, a detachment of battalion marines<span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span>
eighteen hundred strong; three hundred men of the
One Hundred-and-second regiment of the line, commanded
by Lieut.-Colonel Charles James Napier,
afterward a very distinguished officer; two hundred
and fifty chasseurs, or French prisoners of war who
had entered the British service; and three hundred
men of the royal marine artillery,<a id="FNanchor_391" href="#Footnote_391" class="fnanchor">391</a>—in all, two thousand
six hundred and fifty rank-and-file, or about
three thousand men all told, besides the sailors of
the fleet. At that time no less than thirteen sail
of British ships, including three ships-of-the-line and
five frigates, lay at anchor within thirteen miles of
Craney Island.</p>

<p>The attack was planned for June 22. The land
forces were commanded by Sir Sydney Beckwith, but
the general movement was directed by Admiral Warren.<a id="FNanchor_392" href="#Footnote_392" class="fnanchor">392</a>
The main attack, led by Major-General Beckwith
in person, was to land and approach Craney
Island from the rear, or mainland; the second division,
under command of Captain Pechell of the flag-ship
“San Domingo,” 74, was to approach the island
in boats directly under fire of the American guns on
the island, but not exposed to those in the gunboats.</p>

<p>The plan should have succeeded. The island was
held by less than seven hundred men in an open
earthwork easily assaulted from the rear. The water
was so shallow as to offer little protection against
energetic attack. The British force was more than<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
twice the American, and the plan of attack took
from the gunboats the chance of assisting the land-battery.</p>

</figure>

<p>At daylight on the morning of June 22 Beckwith,
with about eight hundred men, landed on the main
shore outside of Craney Island, and pushed forward
to take the island in the rear. Soon afterward
Captain Pechell, with about seven hundred men in
fifteen boats, approached the island from the northwest
along the shore, far out of the reach of the gunboats.
Toward eleven o’clock the British boats came
within range of the American battery on the island.
Contrary to the opinions of several officers, Captain
Pechell insisted on making the attack independently
of Beckwith’s approach, and pushed on. Two or
three hundred yards from land the leading boats
grounded in shoal water. Apparently the men might
have waded ashore; but “one of the seamen, having
plunged his boat-hook over the side, found three or
four feet of slimy mud at the bottom;”<a id="FNanchor_393" href="#Footnote_393" class="fnanchor">393</a> the leading
officer’s boat being aground was soon struck by a six-pound
shot, the boat sunk, and himself and his crew,
with those of two other launches, were left in the
water. The other boats took a part of them in, and
then quickly retired.</p>

<p>The affair was not improved by the fortunes of Sir
Sydney Beckwith, who advanced to the rear of Craney
Island, where he was stopped by creeks which he reported
too deep to ford, and accordingly re-embarked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span>
his troops without further effort; but the true causes
of the failure seemed not to be understood. Napier
thought it due to the division of command between
three heads, Warren, Cockburn, and Beckwith;<a id="FNanchor_394" href="#Footnote_394" class="fnanchor">394</a> but
incompetence was as obvious as the division of command.
Admiral Warren’s official report seemed to
admit that he was also <span class="locked">overmatched:<a id="FNanchor_395" href="#Footnote_395" class="fnanchor">395</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Upon approaching the island, from the extreme shoalness
of the water on the seaside and the difficulty of
getting across from the land, as well as the island itself
being fortified with a number of guns and men from the
frigate [‘Constellation’] and the militia, and flanked
by fifteen gunboats, I considered, in consequence of the
representation of the officer commanding the troops of
the difficulty of their passing over from the land, that
the persevering in the attempt would cost more men
than the number with us would permit, as the other forts
must have been stormed before the frigate and dock-yard
could be destroyed. I therefore directed the troops to
be re-embarked.”</p>
</div>

<p>On neither side were the losses serious. The
American battery inflicted less injury than was to be
expected. Fifteen British boats containing at least
eight hundred men, all told, remained some two hours
under the fire of two twenty-four-pound and four six-pound
guns, at a range differently estimated from
one hundred to three hundred yards, but certainly
beyond musketry fire, for the American troops had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
to wade out before firing. Three boats were sunk;
three men were killed, and sixteen were wounded.<a id="FNanchor_396" href="#Footnote_396" class="fnanchor">396</a>
Sixty-two men were reported missing, twenty-two of
whom came ashore from the boats, while forty deserted
from Beckwith’s land force.<a id="FNanchor_397" href="#Footnote_397" class="fnanchor">397</a> The Americans
suffered no loss.</p>

<p>To compensate his men for their check at Craney
Island, Admiral Warren immediately afterward devised
another movement, which proved, what the
Craney Island affair suggested, that the large British
force in the Chesapeake was either ill constructed or
ill led. Opposite Craney Island, ten miles away on
the north shore of James River, stood the village of
Hampton, a place of no importance either military
or commercial. Four or five hundred Virginia militia
were camped there, covering a heavy battery on the
water’s edge. The battery and its defenders invited
attack, but Admiral Warren could have no military
object to gain by attacking them. His official report<a id="FNanchor_398" href="#Footnote_398" class="fnanchor">398</a>
said “that the enemy having a post at Hampton defended
by a considerable corps commanding the communication
between the upper part of the country
and Norfolk, I considered it advisable, and with a
view to cut off their resources, to direct it to be attacked.”
Hampton could not fairly be said to “command”
communication with Norfolk, a place which
lay beyond ten miles of water wholly commanded by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span>
the British fleet; but Warren was not obliged to
excuse himself for attacking wherever he pleased,
and Hampton served his object best.</p>

<p>At dawn of June 25, Beckwith’s troops were set
ashore about two miles above the village, and moved
forward to the road, taking Hampton in the rear,
while Cockburn’s launches made a feint from the
front. The militia, after resistance costing Beckwith
a total loss of nearly fifty men, escaped, and the
British troops entered the town, where they were allowed
to do what they pleased with property and
persons. Lieutenant-Colonel Napier of the One Hundred-and-second
regiment, who commanded Beckwith’s
advance, wrote in his diary that Sir Sydney
Beckwith “ought to have hanged several villains at
Little Hampton; had he so done, the Americans
would not have complained; but every horror was
perpetrated with impunity,—rape, murder, pillage,—and
not a man was punished.” The British officers
in general shared Napier’s disgust, but alleged that
the English troops took no part in the outrages, which
were wholly the work of the French chasseurs.</p>

<p>Warren made no attempt to hold the town; the
troops returned two days afterward to their ships, and
the Virginia militia resumed their station; but when
the details of the Hampton affair became known, the
story roused natural exasperation throughout the
country, and gave in its turn incitement to more violence
in Canada. Admiral Warren and Sir Sydney
Beckwith did not deny the wrong; they dismissed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span>
their Frenchmen from the service, and the United
States had no further reason to complain of that
corps; but the double mortification seemed to lower
the British officers even in their own eyes to the
level of marauders.</p>

<p>After the failure to destroy the “Constellation,”
Admiral Warren could still indulge a hope of destroying
the twenty-eight-gun frigate “Adams,” and
the navy-yard at Washington; for the defence of the
Potomac had been totally neglected, and only one
indifferent fort, about twelve miles below the Federal
city, needed to be captured. July 1 the British
squadron entered the Potomac; but beyond rousing
a panic at Washington it accomplished nothing, except
to gain some knowledge of the shoals and windings
that impeded the ascent of the river. Leaving
the Potomac, Warren turned up Chesapeake Bay
toward Annapolis and Baltimore, but made no attempt
on either place. During the rest of the year
he cruised about the bay, meeting little resistance,
and keeping the States of Virginia and Maryland in
constant alarm.</p>

<p>Cockburn was more active. In the month of July
he was detached with a squadron carrying Napier’s
One Hundred-and-second regiment, and arrived, July
12, off Ocracoke Inlet, where he captured two fine
privateers,—the “Atlas” and “Anaconda.” Thence
he sailed southward, and established himself for the
winter on Cumberland Island, near the Florida boundary,
where he vexed the Georgians. Besides the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_278">278</span>
property consumed or wasted, he gave refuge to many
fugitive slaves, whom he assisted to the West Indies
or Florida. “Strong is my dislike,” wrote Napier,
“to what is perhaps a necessary part of our job:
namely, plundering and ruining the peasantry. We
drive all their cattle, and of course ruin them. <em>My</em>
hands are clean; but it is hateful to see the poor
Yankees robbed, and to be the robber.”</p>

<p>Compared with the widespread destruction which
war brought on these regions half a century afterward,
the injury inflicted by the British navy in
1813 was trifling, but it served to annoy the Southern
people, who could offer no resistance, and were harassed
by incessant militia-calls. To some extent the
same system of vexation was pursued on the Northern
coast. The Delaware River was blockaded and its
shores much annoyed. New York was also blockaded,
and Nantucket with the adjacent Sounds became
a British naval station. There Sir Thomas Hardy,
Nelson’s favorite, officer, commanded, in his flag-ship
the “Ramillies.” Hardy did not encourage marauding
such as Cockburn practised, but his blockade
was still stringent, and its efficiency was proved by
the failure of Decatur’s efforts to evade it.</p>

<p>Decatur commanded a squadron composed of the
“United States,” its prize frigate the “Macedonian,”
and the sloop-of-war “Hornet,” which lay in the harbor
of New York, waiting for a chance to slip out.
Impatient at the steady watch kept by the British
fleet off Sandy Hook, Decatur brought his three ships<span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span>
through the East River into Long Island Sound. He
reached Montauk Point, May 29, only to find Hardy’s
squadron waiting for him. June 1 he made an attempt
to run out, but was chased back, and took
refuge in the harbor of New London. A large British
squadron immediately closed upon the harbor, and
Decatur not only lost hope of getting to sea but
became anxious for the safety of his ships. He withdrew
them as far as he could into the river, five miles
above the town, and took every precaution to repel
attack. The British officers were said to have declared
that they would get the “Macedonian” back
“even if they followed her into a cornfield.” They
did not make the attempt, but their vigilance never
relaxed, and Decatur was obliged to remain all summer
idle in port. He clung to the hope that when
winter approached he might still escape; but in the
month of December the country was scandalized by
the publication of an official letter from Decatur to
the Secretary of the Navy, charging the people of
New London with the responsibility for his failure.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Some few nights since,” he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_399" href="#Footnote_399" class="fnanchor">399</a> Dec. 20, 1813,
“the weather promised an opportunity for this squadron
to get to sea, and it was said on shore that we intended
to make the attempt. In the course of the evening two
blue lights were burned on both the points at the harbor’s
mouth as signals to the enemy; and there is not a doubt
but that they have, by signals and otherwise, instantaneous
information of our movements. Great but unsuccessful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span>
exertions have been made to detect those who
communicated with the enemy by signal.... Notwithstanding
these signals have been repeated, and have
been seen by twenty persons at least in this squadron,
there are men in New London who have the hardihood
to affect to disbelieve it, and the effrontery to avow
their disbelief.”</p>
</div>

<p>Decatur’s charge roused much ill feeling, and remained
a subject of extreme delicacy with the people
of New London. Perhaps Decatur would have done
better not to make such an assertion until he could
prove its truth. That blue lights, as well as other
lights, were often seen, no one denied; but whether
they came from British or from American hands, or
were burned on sea or on shore, were points much
disputed. The town of New London was three miles
from the river’s mouth, and Decatur’s squadron then
lay at the town. At that distance the precise position
of a light in line with the British fleet might be mistaken.
Decatur’s report, if it proved anything, proved
that the signals were concerted, and were burnt from
“both the points at the river’s mouth.” If the British
admiral wanted information, he could have found
little difficulty in obtaining it; but he would hardly
have arranged a system of signals as visible to Decatur
as to himself. Even had he done so, he might
have employed men in his own service as well as
Americans for the purpose. Decatur’s letter admitted
that he had made great exertions to detect the
culprits, but without success.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span></p>

<p>The rigor of the British blockade extended no
farther north than the Vineyard and Nantucket.
Captain Broke in the “Shannon,” with a companion
frigate, cruised off Boston harbor rather to watch for
ships-of-war than to interfere with neutral commerce.
Along the coast of Maine an illicit trade with the
British provinces was so actively pursued that one
of the few American sloops-of-war, the “Enterprise,”
cruised there, holding smugglers, privateers, and
petty marauders in check. On no other portion of
the coast would an armed national vessel have been
allowed to show itself, but the “Enterprise,” protected
by the bays and inlets of Maine, and favored
by the absence of a blockade, performed a useful service
as a revenue cutter. She was not a first-rate
vessel. Originally a schooner, carrying twelve guns
and sixty men, she had taken part in the war with
Tripoli. She was afterward altered into a brig,
and crowded with sixteen guns and a hundred men.
In 1813 she was commanded by Lieutenant William
Burrows, a Pennsylvanian, who entered the navy in
1799, and, like all the naval heroes, was young,—not
yet twenty-eight years old.</p>

<p>On the morning of September 5, as the “Enterprise”
was cruising eastward, Burrows discovered in
a bay near Portland a strange brig, and gave chase.
The stranger hoisted three English ensigns, fired several
guns, and stood for the “Enterprise.” Perhaps
escape would have been impossible; but the British
captain might, without disgrace, have declined to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
fight, for he was no match for the American. The
“Enterprise” measured about ninety-seven feet in
length; the “Boxer,” as the British brig was named,
measured about eighty-four. The “Enterprise”
was nearly twenty-four feet in extreme width; the
“Boxer” slightly exceeded twenty-two feet. The
“Enterprise” carried fourteen eighteen-pound carronades
and two long-nines; the “Boxer” carried twelve
eighteen-pound carronades and two long-sixes. The
“Enterprise” had a crew of one hundred and two
men; the “Boxer” had only sixty-six men on board.
With such odds against him, the British captain
might have entertained some desperate hope of success,
but could not have expected it.</p>

<p>The behavior of Captain Blyth of the “Boxer”
showed consciousness of his position, for he nailed
his colors to the mast, and told his men that they
were not to be struck while he lived. The day was
calm, and the two brigs manœuvred for a time before
coming together; but at quarter-past three in the afternoon
they exchanged their first broadside within
a stone’s throw of one another. The effect on both
vessels was destructive. Captain Blyth fell dead,
struck full in the body by an eighteen-pound shot.
Lieutenant Burrows fell, mortally wounded, struck by
a canister shot. After another broadside, at half-past
three the “Enterprise” ranged ahead, crossed the
“Boxer’s” bow, and fired one or two more broadsides,
until the “Boxer” hailed and surrendered, her
colors still nailed to the mast.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span></p>

<p>Considering the disparity of force, the two brigs
suffered nearly in equal proportion. The “Boxer”
lost seven men killed or mortally wounded; the
“Enterprise” lost four. The “Boxer” had thirteen
wounded, not fatally; the “Enterprise” had eight.
The “Boxer’s” injuries were not so severe as to
prevent her captors from bringing her as a prize
to Portland; and no incident in this quasi-civil war
touched the sensibilities of the people more deeply
than the common funeral of the two commanders,—both
well known and favorites in the service, buried,
with the same honors and mourners, in the graveyard
at Portland overlooking the scene of their battle.</p>

<p>Neither the battle between the “Enterprise” and
“Boxer,” nor any measures that could be taken by
sea or land, prevented a constant traffic between
Halifax and the New England ports not blockaded.
The United States government seemed afraid to interfere
with it. The newspapers asserted that hundreds
of Americans were actually in Halifax carrying
on a direct trade, and that thousands of barrels of
flour were constantly arriving there from the United
States in vessels carrying the Swedish or other neutral
flag. In truth the government could do little to
enforce its non-intercourse, and even that little might
prove mischievous. Nothing could be worse than the
spirit of the people on the frontier. Engaged in a
profitable illicit commerce, they could only be controlled
by force, and any force not overwhelming
merely provoked violence or treason. The Navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
Department had no vessels to send there, and could
not have prevented their capture if vessels in any
number had been sent. The Secretary of War had
abandoned to the State governments the defence of
the coast. When Armstrong allotted garrisons to the
various military districts, he stationed one regiment,
numbering three hundred and fifty-two effectives,
besides two hundred and sixty-three artillerists, in
Military District No. 1, which included the whole
coast north of Cape Cod, with the towns of Boston,
Marblehead, Salem, Gloucester, Portsmouth, Portland,
and Eastport. Such a provision was hardly sufficient
for garrisoning the fort at Boston. The government
doubtless could spare no more of its small
army, but for any military or revenue purpose might
almost as well have maintained in New England no
force whatever.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">During</span> the month of April, 1813, four American
frigates lay in Boston Harbor fitting for sea. The
“President” and “Congress” returned to that port
Dec. 31, 1812. The “Constitution,” after her battle
with the “Java,” arrived at Boston February 27,
1813. The “Chesapeake” entered in safety April 9,
after an unprofitable cruise of four months. The
presence of these four frigates at Boston offered a
chance for great distinction to the British officer
stationed off the port, and one of the best captains
in the service was there to seize it. In order to
tempt the American frigates to come out boldly, only
two British frigates, the “Shannon” and “Tenedos,”
remained off the harbor. They were commanded by
Captain P.&nbsp;B.&nbsp;V. Broke of the “Shannon.” Broke
expected Rodgers with his ships, the “President”
and “Congress,” to seize the opportunity for a battle
with two ships of no greater force than the “Shannon”
and “Tenedos;” but either Rodgers did not
understand the challenge or did not trust it, or took
a different view of his duties, for he went to sea on
the night of April 30, leaving Broke greatly chagrined<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span>
and inclined to be somewhat indignant with him for
escaping.<a id="FNanchor_400" href="#Footnote_400" class="fnanchor">400</a></p>

<p>After May 1, Broke on the watch outside, as he
ran in toward Nahant, could see the masts of only
the “Constitution” and “Chesapeake” at the Charlestown
navy-yard, and his anxiety became the greater
as he noticed that the “Chesapeake” was apparently
ready for sea.<a id="FNanchor_401" href="#Footnote_401" class="fnanchor">401</a> May 25 Broke sent away his consort,
the “Tenedos,” to cruise from Cape Sable southward,
ostensibly because the two frigates cruising separately
would have a better chance of intercepting the “Chesapeake”
than if they kept together.<a id="FNanchor_402" href="#Footnote_402" class="fnanchor">402</a> His stronger
reason was to leave a fair field for the “Chesapeake”
and “Shannon,” as he had before kept all force at
a distance except the “Shannon” and “Tenedos” in
order to tempt Rodgers to fight.<a id="FNanchor_403" href="#Footnote_403" class="fnanchor">403</a> That there might
be no second misunderstanding, he sent several messages
to Captain Lawrence commanding the “Chesapeake,”
inviting a combat.</p>

<p>Nothing showed so clearly that at least one object
of the war had been gained by the Americans as the
habit adopted by both navies in 1813 of challenging
ship-duels. War took an unusual character when
officers like Hardy and Broke countenanced such a
practice, discussing and arranging duels between
matched ships, on terms which implied that England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>
admitted half-a-dozen American frigates to be equal
in value to the whole British navy. The loss of a
British frigate mattered little to a government which
had more than a hundred such frigates actually at
sea, not to speak of heavier ships; but the loss
of the “Chesapeake” was equivalent to destroying
nearly one fourth of the disposable American navy.
Already the “Constellation” was imprisoned at Norfolk;
the “United States” and “Macedonian” were
blockaded for the war; the “Congress” though at
sea was unseaworthy and never cruised again; the
“Adams” was shut in the Potomac; the “Essex”
was in the Pacific. The United States Navy consisted,
for active service on the Atlantic, of only
the “President,” 44, at sea; the “Constitution,” 44,
replacing her masts at the Charlestown navy-yard;
the “Chesapeake,” 38, ready for sea; and a few
sloops-of-war. Under such circumstances, British
officers who like Broke considered every American
frigate bound to offer them equal terms in a duel,
seemed to admit that the American service had
acquired the credit it claimed.</p>

<p>The first duty of a British officer was to take risks;
the first duty of an American officer was to avoid
them, and to fight only at his own time, on his own
terms. Rodgers properly declined to seek a battle
with Broke’s ships. Captain James Lawrence of the
“Chesapeake” was less cautious, for his experience in
the war led him to think worse of the British navy than
it deserved. Lawrence commanded the “Hornet” in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span>
Bainbridge’s squadron at the time of the “Java’s”
capture. Bainbridge and Lawrence blockaded the
“Bonne Citoyenne,” a twenty-gun sloop-of-war at San
Salvador in Brazil. Lawrence sent a message to the
captain of the “Bonne Citoyenne” inviting him to
come out and meet the “Hornet.” The British captain
declined, doubtless for proper reasons; but the
reason he gave seemed to Lawrence insufficient, for
it was merely that Commodore Bainbridge, in spite
of his pledged word, might interfere.<a id="FNanchor_404" href="#Footnote_404" class="fnanchor">404</a> Bainbridge
sailed about Christmas, and was absent till January
3, capturing the “Java” in the interval. January
6 he sailed for Boston, leaving Lawrence in the
“Hornet” still blockading the “Bonne Citoyenne,”
which showed no more disposition to fight the
“Hornet” in Bainbridge’s absence than before, although
the British captain’s letter had said that
“nothing could give me greater satisfaction than
complying with the wishes of Captain Lawrence”
if the single alleged objection were removed.</p>

<p>The conduct of the “Bonne Citoyenne”—a vessel
at least the equal of the “Hornet”<a id="FNanchor_405" href="#Footnote_405" class="fnanchor">405</a>—gave Lawrence
a low opinion of the British service, and his respect
was not increased by his next experience. A British
seventy-four arrived at San Salvador, January 24,
and obliged the “Hornet” to abandon the “Bonne
Citoyenne.” During the next month the little vessel
cruised northward along the Brazil coast, making a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span>
few prizes, until February 24 off the mouth of Demerara
River, at half-past three o’clock in the afternoon,
Captain Lawrence discovered a sail approaching
him. Within the bar at the mouth of the river,
seven or eight miles distant, he saw another vessel
at anchor. Both were British sloops-of-war. The
one at anchor was the “Espiègle,” carrying eighteen
thirty-two-pound carronades. The other, approaching
on the “Hornet’s” weather-quarter, was
the “Peacock,” carrying eighteen twenty-four-pound
carronades, two long-sixes, and one or two lighter
pieces.</p>

<p>The “Peacock,” according to British report,<a id="FNanchor_406" href="#Footnote_406" class="fnanchor">406</a> had
long been “the admiration of her numerous visitors,”
and was remarkable for the elegance of her fittings;
but in size she was inferior to the “Hornet.” Lawrence
reported his ship to be four feet the longer,
but the British believed the “Hornet” to measure
one hundred and twelve feet in length, while the
“Peacock” measured one hundred.<a id="FNanchor_407" href="#Footnote_407" class="fnanchor">407</a> Their breadth
was the same. The “Hornet” carried eighteen thirty-two-pounders,
while the British captain, thinking his
sloop too light for thirty-twos, had exchanged them
for twenty-fours, and carried only sixteen. The
American crew numbered one hundred and thirty-five
men fit for duty; the British numbered one
hundred and twenty-two men and boys.</p>

<p>At ten minutes past five, Lawrence tacked and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>
stood for the brig. Fifteen minutes afterward the
two vessels, sailing in opposite directions, passed each
other and exchanged broadsides within a stone’s-throw.
The British fire, even at point-blank range
of forty or fifty feet, did no harm, while the “Hornet’s”
broadside must have decided the battle; for
although both vessels instantly wore, and Lawrence
at thirty-five minutes past five ran his enemy close
aboard, the “Peacock” almost immediately struck
at thirty-nine minutes past five in a sinking condition,
and actually went down immediately afterward,
carrying with her nine of the “Peacock’s” wounded
and three of the “Hornet’s” crew.</p>

<p>The ease of this victory was beyond proportion to
the odds. The British captain and four men were
killed outright, thirty-three officers and men were
wounded, and the brig was sunk in an action of less
than fifteen minutes; while the “Hornet” lost one
man killed and two wounded, all aloft, and not a
shot penetrated her hull. If the facility of this triumph
satisfied Lawrence of his easy superiority in
battle, the conduct of the “Espiègle” convinced him
that the British service was worse than incompetent.
Lawrence, expecting every moment to see the “Espiègle”
get under weigh, made great exertions to put his
ship in readiness for a new battle, but to his astonishment
the British brig took no notice of the action.<a id="FNanchor_408" href="#Footnote_408" class="fnanchor">408</a>
Subsequent investigation showed that the “Espiègle”
knew nothing of the battle until the next day; but<span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span>
Lawrence, assuming that the British captain must
have seen or heard, or at least ought to have suspected
what was happening, conceived that cowardice
was a trait of the British navy.</p>

<p>When Lawrence reached New York he became
famous for his victory, and received at once promotion.
The “Hornet,” given to Captain Biddle, was
attached to Decatur’s squadron and blockaded at
New London, while Lawrence received command of
the “Chesapeake.” Lawrence was then thirty-two
years old; he was born in New Jersey in 1781, entered
the navy in 1798, and served in the war with
Tripoli. He was first lieutenant on the “Constitution,”
and passed to the grade of commander in 1810,
commanding successively the “Vixen,” the “Wasp,”
the “Argus,” and the “Hornet.” His appointment
to the “Chesapeake” was an accident, owing to the
ill health of Captain Evans, who commanded her on
her recent cruise. The “Chesapeake’s” reputation
for ill luck clung to her so persistently that neither
officers nor men cared greatly to sail in her, and
Lawrence would have preferred to remain in the
“Hornet;”<a id="FNanchor_409" href="#Footnote_409" class="fnanchor">409</a> but his instructions were positive, and
he took command of the “Chesapeake” about the
middle of May. Most of the officers and crew were
new. The old crew on reaching port, April 9, had
been discharged, and left the ship, dissatisfied with
their share of prize-money, and preferring to try the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_292">292</span>
privateer service. The new crew was unequal in
quality and required training; they neither knew
their officers nor each other.</p>

<p>Lawrence’s opponent, Captain Broke of the “Shannon,”
was an officer whose courage could as little
be questioned as his energy or skill. Among all
the commanders in the British service Broke had
profited most by the lessons of the war. More
than seven years’ experience of his ship and crew
gave him every advantage of discipline and system.
Nearly every day the officers at the Charlestown
navy-yard could see the “Shannon” outside, practising
her guns at floating targets as she sailed
about the bay. Broke’s most anxious wish was to
fight the “Chesapeake,” which he considered to be
of the same size with the “Shannon.”<a id="FNanchor_410" href="#Footnote_410" class="fnanchor">410</a> The two frigates
were the same length within a few inches,—between
one hundred and fifty, and one hundred and
fifty-one feet. Their breadth was forty feet within
a few inches. The “Chesapeake” carried eighteen
thirty-two-pound carronades on the spar-deck; the
“Shannon” carried sixteen. Each carried twenty-eight
long eighteen-pounders on the gun-deck. The
“Chesapeake” carried also two long twelve-pounders
and a long eighteen-pounder, besides a twelve-pound
carronade. The “Shannon” carried four long nine-pounders,
a long six-pounder, and three twelve-pound
carronades. The “Chesapeake’s” only decided advantage
was in the number of her crew, which consisted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>
of three hundred and seventy-nine men, while
the “Shannon” carried three hundred and thirty
all told.</p>

<p>Broke sent the “Tenedos” away May 25, but Lawrence
was not aware of it, and wrote, May 27, to
Captain Biddle of the “Hornet” a letter, showing
that till the last moment he hoped not to sail in
the <span class="locked">“Chesapeake:”<a id="FNanchor_411" href="#Footnote_411" class="fnanchor">411</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In hopes of being relieved by Captain Stewart, I
neglected writing to you according to promise; but as
I have given over all hopes of seeing him, and the ‘Chesapeake’
is almost ready, I shall sail on Sunday, provided
I have a chance of getting out clear of the ‘Shannon’
and ‘Tenedos,’ who are on the look-out.”</p>
</div>

<p>Sunday, May 30, the ship was ready, though the
crew was not as good or as well disciplined as it
should have been, and showed some discontent owing
to difficulties about prize-money. On the morning of
June 1 the frigate was lying in President’s Roads,
when between eight and nine o’clock the second lieutenant,
George Budd, reported a sail in sight. Captain
Lawrence went up the main rigging, and having
made out the sail to be a large frigate, ordered the
crew to be mustered, and told them he meant to
fight. At midday he stood down the harbor and
out to sea. The “Shannon,” outside, stood off under
easy sail, and led the way until five o’clock, when
she luffed and waited till the “Chesapeake” came
up. As the wind was westerly, Lawrence had the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span>
choice of position, but he made no attempt to profit
by his advantage, although it might have been decisive.
Bringing the “Chesapeake” with a fresh
breeze directly down on the “Shannon’s” quarter, at
half-past five he luffed, at about fifty yards distance,
and ranged up abeam on the “Shannon’s” starboard
side.</p>

<p>The “Shannon” opened fire as her guns began to
bear, but discharged only her two sternmost guns
when the “Chesapeake” replied. The two ships ran
on about seven minutes, or about the length of time
necessary for two discharges of the first guns fired,
when, some of the “Shannon’s” shot having cut
away the “Chesapeake’s” foretopsail tie and jib-sheet,
the ship came up into the wind and was taken aback.
Lying with her larboard quarter toward the “Shannon’s”
side, at some forty or fifty yards distance,
she began to drift toward her enemy. None of the
“Chesapeake’s” guns then bore on the “Shannon,”
and the American frigate wholly ceased firing.</p>

<p>From the moment the “Chesapeake” was taken
aback she was a beaten ship, and the crew felt it.
She could be saved only by giving her headway, or
by boarding the “Shannon;” but neither expedient
was possible. The effort to make sail forward was
tried, and proved futile. The idea of boarding was
also in Lawrence’s mind, but the situation made it
impracticable. As the “Chesapeake” drifted stern-foremost
toward the “Shannon,” every gun in the
British broadside swept the American deck diagonally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span>
from stern to stem, clearing the quarter-deck
and beating in the stern-ports, while the musketry
from the “Shannon’s” tops killed the men at the
“Chesapeake’s” wheel, and picked off every officer,
sailor, or marine in the after-part of the ship. Boarders
could not be rallied under a fire which obliged
them to seek cover. The men on the spar-deck left
their stations, crowding forward or going below.</p>

<figure id="i_295" class="figcenter" style="max-width: 35em;">
  <img src="images/i_295.jpg" width="1635" height="443" alt=" ">
  <figcaption class="caption"><i>Chesapeake</i><br><i>Shannon</i>
  </figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Nevertheless, Lawrence ordered up his boarders,—he
could do nothing else; but the affair hurried
with such rapidity to its close that almost at the
same instant the “Chesapeake’s” quarter touched
the “Shannon” amidships. From the moment when
the “Chesapeake” was taken aback until the moment
when she fell foul, only four minutes were given for
Lawrence to act. Before these four minutes were
at an end, he was struck and mortally wounded by
a musket-ball from the “Shannon.” His first lieutenant,
Ludlow, had already been carried below,
wounded. His second lieutenant, Budd, was stationed
below. His third lieutenant, Cox, improperly
assisted Lawrence to reach the gun-deck. Not an
officer remained on the spar-deck, and neither an
officer nor a living man was on the quarter-deck
when the “Chesapeake’s” quarter came against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span>
“Shannon’s” gangway, as though inviting the British
captain to take possession.</p>

<p>As the ships fouled, Broke ran forward and called
for boarders. With about twenty men he stepped on
the “Chesapeake’s” quarter-deck, and was followed
by thirty more before the ships parted. The error
should have cost him his life and the lives of all who
were with him, for the Americans might easily have
killed every man of the boarding-party in spite of
the fire from the “Shannon.” For several moments
Broke was in the utmost peril, not only from the
American crew but from his own. His first lieutenant,
Watt, hastening to haul down the American
ensign, was killed by the discharge of a cannon
from the “Shannon;” and when Broke, leaving the
“Chesapeake’s” quarter-deck, went forward to clear
the forecastle, enough of the American crew were
there to make a sharp resistance. Broke himself
was obliged to take part in the scuffle. According
to his report, he “received a severe sabre-wound at
the first onset, whilst charging a part of the enemy
who had rallied on their forecastle.” According to
another British account he was first knocked down
with the butt-end of a musket, and then was cut by
a broadsword. Of his fifty boarders, not less than
thirty-seven were killed or wounded.<a id="FNanchor_412" href="#Footnote_412" class="fnanchor">412</a></p>

<p>Had the American crew been in a proper state of
discipline, the struggle would have taken an extraordinary
character, and the two ships might have renewed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span>
the combat, without officers, and in a more
or less unmanageable condition. Fortunately for
Broke, his fifty men outnumbered the Americans on
the spar-deck, while the men below, for the most
part, would not come up. About a score of sailors
and marines were on the forecastle, and about a
dozen more rushed up from below, led by the second
lieutenant, George Budd, as soon as he, at his
station on the main-deck, learned what was happening
above; but so rapidly did the whole affair pass,
that in two minutes the scuffle was over, the Americans
were killed or thrown down the hatchway, and
the ship was helpless, with its spar-deck in the hands
of Broke’s boarders. The guns ceased firing, and the
crew below surrendered after some musket-shots up
and down the hatchways.</p>

<p>The disgrace to the Americans did not consist so
much in the loss of a ship to one of equal force, as in
the shame of suffering capture by a boarding-party
of fifty men. As Lawrence lay wounded in the cockpit,
he saw the rush of his men from the spar-deck
down the after-ladders, and cried out repeatedly and
loudly, “Don’t give up the ship! blow her up!”
He was said to have added afterward: “I could have
stood the wreck if it had not been for the boarding.”</p>

<p>Doubtless the “Shannon” was the better ship, and
deserved to win. Her crew could under no circumstances
have behaved like the crew of the “Chesapeake.”
In discipline she was admittedly superior;
but the question of superiority in other respects was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
not decided. The accident that cut the “Chesapeake’s”
jib-sheet and brought her into the wind was
the only decisive part of the battle, and was mere
ill luck, such as pursued the “Chesapeake” from the
beginning. As far as could be seen, in the favorite
American work of gunnery the “Shannon” showed
no superiority.</p>

<p>On that point the reports agreed. The action began
at half-past five o’clock in the afternoon at close
range. In seven minutes the “Chesapeake” forged
ahead, came into the wind and ceased firing, as none
of her guns could be made to bear. Seven minutes
allowed time at the utmost for two discharges of
some of her guns. No more guns were fired from the
“Chesapeake” till she drifted close to the “Shannon.”
Then her two sternmost guns, the thirteenth
and fourteenth on the main deck, again bore on the
enemy, and were depressed and fired by Lieutenant
Cox while the boarders were fighting on the spar-deck.<a id="FNanchor_413" href="#Footnote_413" class="fnanchor">413</a>
Thus the number of discharges from the
“Chesapeake’s” guns could be known within reasonable
certainty. She carried in her broadside nine
thirty-two-pounders and fourteen or fifteen eighteen-pounders,
besides one twelve-pounder,—twenty-five
guns. Assuming them to have been all discharged
twice, although the forward guns could scarcely have
been discharged more than once, the “Chesapeake”
could have fired only fifty-two shot, including the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span>
two eighteen-pounders fired by Lieutenant Cox at
the close.</p>

<p>According to the official report nearly every shot
must have taken effect. The “Shannon” was struck
by thirteen thirty-two-pound shot; the “Chesapeake”
fired only eighteen, if she discharged every gun twice.
The “Shannon” was struck by twelve eighteen-pound
shot, fourteen bar-shot, and one hundred and nineteen
grape-shot; the “Chesapeake’s” fifteen eighteen-pounders
could hardly have done more in the space
of seven minutes. In truth, every shot that was fired
probably took effect.</p>

<p>The casualties showed equal efficiency of fire, and
when compared with other battles were severe. When
the “Guerriere” struck to the “Constitution” in the
previous year, she had lost in half an hour of close
action twenty-three killed or mortally wounded and
fifty-six more or less injured. The “Shannon” seems
to have lost in eleven minutes, before boarding,
twenty-seven men killed or mortally wounded and
nineteen more or less injured.<a id="FNanchor_414" href="#Footnote_414" class="fnanchor">414</a></p>

<p>The relative efficiency of the “Shannon’s” gunnery
was not so clear, because the “Shannon’s” battery
continued to fire after the “Chesapeake” ceased. As
the “Chesapeake” drifted down on the “Shannon”
she was exposed to the broadside of the British
frigate, while herself unable to fire a gun.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The shot from the ‘Shannon’s’ aftermost guns now
had a fair range along the ‘Chesapeake’s’ decks,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
the British account,<a id="FNanchor_415" href="#Footnote_415" class="fnanchor">415</a> “beating in the stern-ports and
sweeping the men from their quarters. The shots from
the foremost guns at the same time entering the ports
from the mainmast aft did considerable execution.”</p>
</div>

<p>Broke’s biographer<a id="FNanchor_416" href="#Footnote_416" class="fnanchor">416</a> said that the “Chesapeake”
fired but one broadside, and then coming into the
wind drifted down, “exposed while making this crippled
and helpless movement to the ‘Shannon’s’ second
and most deliberate broadside.” The “Chesapeake”
was very near, almost touching the British
frigate during the four or five minutes of this fire,
and every shot must have taken effect. Broke ordered
the firing to cease when he boarded, but one
gun was afterward discharged, and killed the British
first lieutenant as he was lowering the American flag
on the “Chesapeake’s” quarter-deck.</p>

<p>The “Shannon’s” fire lasted eleven or twelve minutes.
She carried twenty-five guns in broadside.<a id="FNanchor_417" href="#Footnote_417" class="fnanchor">417</a>
Eight of these were thirty-two-pound carronades,
and the official report showed that the “Chesapeake”
was struck by twenty-five thirty-two-pound
shot, showing that three full broadsides were fired
from the “Shannon,” and at least one gun was
discharged four times. The “Shannon’s” broadside
also carried fourteen eighteen-pounders, which
threw twenty-nine shot into the “Chesapeake,” besides
much canister and grape. Considering that
at least half the “Shannon’s” shot were fired at so<span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span>
close a range that they could not fail to take effect,
nothing proved that her guns were better served than
those of the “Chesapeake.” The “Shannon,” according
to the British account, fired twice as many shot
under twice as favorable conditions, but the injury
she inflicted was not twice the injury inflicted in
return. Setting aside the grape-shot, the “Chesapeake”
struck the “Shannon” thirty-nine times; the
“Shannon” struck the “Chesapeake” fifty-seven
times. Including the grape-shot, which Broke used
freely, the “Shannon” probably did better, but even
with a liberal allowance for grape and canister,
nothing proved her superiority at the guns.</p>

<p>The loss in men corresponded with the injury to
the ships. The “Shannon” lost eighty-three killed
and wounded; the “Chesapeake” lost one hundred
and forty-six. Thirty-three of the “Shannon’s” men
were killed or died of their wounds; sixty-one of
the “Chesapeake’s” number were killed or mortally
wounded.</p>

<p>The injuries suffered by the “Chesapeake” told the
same story, for they were chiefly in the stern, and
were inflicted by the “Shannon’s” second and third
broadsides, after the “Chesapeake” ceased firing.
The “Chesapeake’s” bowsprit received no injury, and
not a spar of any kind was shot away. The “Shannon”
carried her prize into Halifax with all its masts
standing, and without anxiety for its safety.</p>

<p>The news of Broke’s victory was received in England
and by the British navy with an outburst of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span>
pleasure that proved the smart of the wound inflicted
by Hull, Decatur, and Bainbridge. The two official
expressions of Broke’s naval and civil superiors
probably reflected the unexaggerated emotion of the
service.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“At this critical moment,” wrote Admiral Warren<a id="FNanchor_418" href="#Footnote_418" class="fnanchor">418</a>
by a curious coincidence the day before his own somewhat
less creditable defeat at Craney Island, “you could
not have restored to the British naval service the pre-eminence
it has always preserved, or contradicted in a
more forcible manner the foul aspersions and calumnies
of a conceited, boasting enemy, than by the brilliant act
you have performed.”</p>
</div>

<p>A few days later he wrote <span class="locked">again:<a id="FNanchor_419" href="#Footnote_419" class="fnanchor">419</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The relation of such an event restores the history of
ancient times, and will do more good to the service than
it is possible to conceive.”</p>
</div>

<p>In Parliament, July 8, John Wilson Croker said:<a id="FNanchor_420" href="#Footnote_420" class="fnanchor">420</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The action which he [Broke] fought with the ‘Chesapeake’
was in every respect unexampled. It was not—and
he knew it was a bold assertion which he made—to
be surpassed by any engagement which graced the naval
annals of Great Britain.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Government made Broke a baronet, but gave
him few other rewards, and his wound was too serious
to permit future hard service. Lawrence died
June 5, before the ships reached Halifax. His first
lieutenant, Ludlow, also died. Their bodies were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span>
brought to New York and buried September 16, with
formal services at Trinity Church.</p>

<p>By the Americans the defeat was received at first
with incredulity and boundless anxiety, followed by
extreme discouragement. The news came at a dark
moment, when every hope had been disappointed and
the outlook was gloomy beyond all that had been
thought possible.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I remember,” wrote Richard Rush in later life,—“what
American does not!—the first rumor of it. I
remember the startling sensation. I remember at first
the universal incredulity. I remember how the post-offices
were thronged for successive days by anxious
thousands; how collections of citizens rode out for miles
on the highway, accosting the mail to catch something
by anticipation. At last, when the certainty was known,
I remember the public gloom; funeral orations and badges
of mourning bespoke it. ‘Don’t give up the ship!’—the
dying words of Lawrence—were on every tongue.”</p>
</div>

<p>Six weeks afterward another American naval captain
lost another American vessel-of-war by reason
of the same over-confidence which caused Lawrence’s
mistakes, and in a manner equally discreditable to
the crew. The “Argus” was a small brig, built in
1803, rating sixteen guns. In the summer of 1813
she was commanded by Captain W.&nbsp;H. Allen, of Rhode
Island, who had been third officer to Barron when
he was attacked in the “Chesapeake” by the “Leopard.”
Allen was the officer who snatched a coal
from the galley and discharged the only gun that
was fired that day. On leaving the “Chesapeake,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Allen was promoted to be first officer in the “United
States.” To his exertions in training the men to
the guns, Decatur attributed his superiority in gunnery
over the “Macedonian.” To him fell one of
the most distinguished honors that ever came to the
share of an American naval officer,—that of successfully
bringing the “Macedonian” to port. Promoted
to the rank of captain, he was put in command of
the “Argus,” and ordered to take William Henry
Crawford to his post as Minister to France.</p>

<p>On that errand the “Argus” sailed, June 18, and
after safely landing Crawford, July 11, at Lorient
in Brittany, Captain Allen put to sea again, three
days afterward, and in pursuance of his instructions
cruised off the mouth of the British Channel. During
an entire month he remained between the coast of
Brittany and the coast of Ireland, destroying a score
of vessels and creating a panic among the ship-owners
and underwriters of London. Allen performed his
task with as much forbearance as the duty permitted,
making no attempt to save his prizes for the sake
of prize-money, and permitting all passengers to take
what they claimed as their own without inspection or
restraint. The English whose property he destroyed
spoke of him without personal ill-feeling.</p>

<p>The anxiety and labor of such a service falling on
a brig of three hundred tons and a crew of a hundred
men, and the impunity with which he defied
danger, seemed to make Allen reckless. On the
night of August 13 he captured a brig laden with<span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span>
wine from Oporto. Within sight of the Welsh coast
and within easy reach of Milford Haven, he burned his
prize, not before part of his crew got drunk on the
wine. The British brig “Pelican,” then cruising in
search of the “Argus,” guided by the light of the
burning prize, at five o’clock on the morning of August
14 came down on the American brig; and Captain
Allen, who had often declared that he would run
from no two-masted vessel, waited for his enemy.</p>

<p>According to British measurements, the “Argus”
was ninety-five and one-half feet long; the “Pelican,”
one hundred. The “Argus” was twenty-seven feet,
seven and five-eighths inches in extreme breadth; the
“Pelican” was thirty feet, nine inches. The “Argus”
carried eighteen twenty-four-pound carronades, and
two long twelve-pounders; the “Pelican” carried
sixteen thirty-two-pound carronades, four long six-pounders,
and a twelve-pound carronade. The number
of the “Argus’s” crew was disputed. According
to British authority, it was one hundred and twenty-seven,<a id="FNanchor_421" href="#Footnote_421" class="fnanchor">421</a>
while the “Pelican” carried one hundred and
sixteen men and boys.<a id="FNanchor_422" href="#Footnote_422" class="fnanchor">422</a></p>

<p>At six o’clock in the morning, according to American
reckoning,<a id="FNanchor_423" href="#Footnote_423" class="fnanchor">423</a>—at half-past five according to the
British report,—the “Argus” wore, and fired a
broadside within grape-distance, which was returned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span>
with cannon and musketry. Within five minutes
Captain Allen was struck by a shot which carried
away his left leg, mortally wounding him; and five
minutes afterward the first lieutenant was wounded
on the head by a grape-shot. Although the second
lieutenant fought the brig well, the guns were surprisingly
inefficient. During the first fifteen minutes
the “Argus” had the advantage of position, and at
eighteen minutes after six raked the “Pelican” at
close range, but inflicted no great injury on the enemy’s
hull or rigging, and killed at the utmost but
one man, wounding only five. According to an English
account,<a id="FNanchor_424" href="#Footnote_424" class="fnanchor">424</a> “the ‘Argus’ fought well while the cannonading
continued, but her guns were not levelled
with precision, and many shots passed through the
‘Pelican’s’ royals.” The “Pelican,” at the end of
twenty-five minutes, succeeded in cutting up her opponent’s
rigging so that the “Argus” lay helpless
under her guns. The “Pelican” then took a position
on her enemy’s starboard quarter, and raked
her with eight thirty-two-pound carronades for nearly
twenty minutes at close range, without receiving a
shot in return except from musketry. According to
the report of the British captain, the action “was
kept up with great spirit on both sides forty-three
minutes, when we lay her alongside, and were in the
act of boarding when she struck her colors.”<a id="FNanchor_425" href="#Footnote_425" class="fnanchor">425</a></p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span></p>

<p>The “Argus” repeated the story of the “Chesapeake,”
except that the action lasted three quarters
of an hour instead of fifteen minutes. During that
time, the “Pelican” should have fired all her broadside
eight or ten times into the “Argus” at a range
so close that no shot should have missed. Sixty
thirty-two-pound shot fired into a small brig less
than one hundred feet long should have shivered it
to atoms. Nine thirty-two-pound shot from the “Hornet”
seemed to reduce the “Peacock” to a sinking
condition in fifteen minutes; yet the “Argus” was
neither sunk nor dismasted. The British account of
her condition after the battle showed no more injury
than was suffered by the “Peacock,” even in killed
and wounded, by one or at the utmost two broadsides
of the “Hornet.”</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The ‘Argus’ was tolerably cut up in her hull.
Both her lower masts were wounded, although not badly,
and her fore-shrouds on one side nearly all destroyed;
but like the ‘Chesapeake,’ the ‘Argus’ had no spar shot
away. Of her carronades several were disabled. She
lost in the action six seamen killed; her commander, two
midshipmen, the carpenter, and three seamen mortally,
her first lieutenant and five seamen severely, and eight
others slightly wounded,—total twenty-four; chiefly, if
not wholly by the cannon-shot of the ‘Pelican.’”<a id="FNanchor_426" href="#Footnote_426" class="fnanchor">426</a></p>
</div>

<p>The “Pelican” lost seven men killed or wounded,
chiefly by musketry. On both sides the battle
showed little skill with the guns; but perhaps the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span>
“Pelican,” considering her undisputed superiority
during half the combat, showed even less than the
“Argus.” As in the “Chesapeake’s” battle, the
discredit of the defeated ship lay in surrender to
boarders.</p>

<p>Two such defeats were calculated to shake confidence
in the American navy. That Allen should
have been beaten in gunnery was the more strange,
because his training with the guns gave him his chief
credit with Decatur. Watson, the second lieutenant
of the “Argus,” attributed the defeat to the fatigue
of his crew. Whatever was the immediate cause, no
one could doubt that both the “Chesapeake” and
“Argus” were sacrificed to the over-confidence of
their commanders.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XIII"><span id="toclink_309"></span>CHAPTER XIII.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">The</span> people of the Atlantic coast felt the loss of the
“Chesapeake” none too keenly. Other nations had
a history to support them in moments of mortification,
or had learned by centuries of experience to
accept turns of fortune as the fate of war. The
American of the sea-coast was not only sensitive and
anxious, but he also saw with singular clearness the
bearing of every disaster, and did not see with equal
distinctness the general drift of success. The loss of
the “Chesapeake” was a terrible disaster, not merely
because it announced the quick recovery of England’s
pride and power from a momentary shock, but also
because it threatened to take away the single object
of American enthusiasm which redeemed shortcomings
elsewhere. After the loss of the “Chesapeake,”
no American frigate was allowed the opportunity to
fight with an equal enemy. The British frigates,
ordered to cruise in company, gave the Americans
no chance to renew their triumphs of 1812.</p>

<p>Indeed, the experience of 1813 tended to show that
the frigate was no longer the class of vessel best
suited to American wants. Excessively expensive
compared with their efficiency, the “Constitution,”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span>
“President,” and “United States” could only with
difficulty obtain crews; and when after much delay
they were ready for sea, they could not easily evade
a blockading squadron. The original cost of a frigate
varied from two hundred thousand dollars to three
hundred thousand; that of a sloop-of-war, like the
“Hornet,” “Wasp,” or “Argus,” varied between forty
and fifty thousand dollars. The frigate required a
crew of about four hundred men; the sloop carried
about one hundred and fifty. The annual expense
of a frigate in active service was about one hundred
and thirty-four thousand dollars; that of the brig was
sixty thousand. The frigate required much time and
heavy timber in her construction; the sloop could be
built quickly and of ordinary material. The loss of
a frigate was a severe national disaster; the loss of a
sloop was not a serious event.</p>

<p>For defensive purposes neither the frigate nor the
brig counted heavily against a nation which employed
ships-of-the-line by dozens; but even for offensive objects
the frigate was hardly so useful as the sloop-of-war.
The record of the frigates for 1813 showed
no results equivalent to their cost. Their cruises
were soon told. The “President,” leaving Boston
April 30, ran across to the Azores, thence to the
North Sea, and during June and July haunted the
shores of Norway, Scotland, and Ireland, returning to
Newport September 27, having taken thirteen prizes.
The “Congress,” which left Boston with the “President,”
cruised nearly eight months in the Atlantic,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span>
and returned to Boston December 14, having captured
but four merchantmen. The “Chesapeake,”
which sailed from Boston Dec. 13, 1812, cruised four
months in the track of British commerce, past Madeira
and Cape de Verde, across the equator, and
round through the West Indies, returning to Boston
April 9, having taken six prizes; at the beginning
of her next cruise, June 1, the “Chesapeake” was
herself captured. The adventures of the “Essex”
in the Pacific were such as might have been equally
well performed by a sloop-of-war, and belonged rather
to the comparative freedom with which the frigates
moved in 1812 than to the difficult situation that
followed. No other frigates succeeded in getting to
sea till December 4, when the “President” sailed
again. The injury inflicted by the frigates on the
Atlantic was therefore the capture of twenty-three
merchantmen in a year. At the close of 1813, the
“President” and the “Essex” were the only frigates
at sea; the “Constitution” sailed from Boston only
Jan. 1, 1814; the “United States” and “Macedonian”
were blockaded at New London; the “Constellation”
was still at Norfolk; the “Adams” was
at Washington, and the “Congress” at Boston.</p>

<p>When this record was compared with that of the
sloops-of-war the frigates were seen to be luxuries.
The sloop-of-war was a single-decked vessel, rigged
sometimes as a ship, sometimes as a brig, but never
as a sloop, measuring about one hundred and ten feet
in length by thirty in breadth, and carrying usually<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span>
eighteen thirty-two-pound carronades and two long
twelve-pounders. Of this class the American navy
possessed in 1812 only four examples,—the “Hornet,”
the “Wasp,” the “Argus,” and the “Syren.”
The “Wasp” was lost Oct. 18, 1812, after capturing
the “Frolic.” The “Syren” remained at New Orleans
during the first year of the war, and then came
to Boston, but saw no ocean service of importance
during 1813. The “Hornet” made three prizes, including
the sloop-of-war “Peacock,” and was then
blockaded with the “United States” and “Macedonian;”
but the smaller vessel could do what the
frigates could not, and in November the “Hornet”
slipped out of New London and made her way to
New York, where she waited an opportunity to escape
to sea. The story will show her success. Finally,
the “Argus” cruised for a month in the British
Channel, and made twenty-one prizes before she was
captured by the “Pelican.”</p>

<p>The three frigates, “President,” “Congress,” and
“Chesapeake,” captured twenty-three prizes in the
course of the year, and lost the “Chesapeake.” The
two sloops, the “Hornet” and “Argus,” captured
twenty-four prizes, including the sloop-of-war “Peacock,”
and lost the “Argus.”</p>

<p>The government at the beginning of the war owned
four smaller vessels,—the “Nautilus” and “Vixen”
of fourteen guns, and the “Enterprise” and “Viper”
of twelve. Another brig, the “Rattlesnake,” sixteen,
was bought. Experience seemed to prove that these<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span>
were of little use. The “Nautilus” fell into the
hands of Broke’s squadron July 16, 1812, within a
month after the declaration of war. The “Vixen”
was captured Nov. 22, 1812, by Sir James Yeo. The
“Viper,” Jan. 17, 1813, became prize to Captain
Lumley in the British frigate “Narcissus.” The
“Enterprise” distinguished itself by capturing the
“Boxer,” and was regarded as a lucky vessel, but
was never a good or fast one.<a id="FNanchor_427" href="#Footnote_427" class="fnanchor">427</a> The “Rattlesnake,”
though fast, was at last caught on a lee shore by the
frigate “Leander,” July 11, 1814, and carried into
Halifax.<a id="FNanchor_428" href="#Footnote_428" class="fnanchor">428</a></p>

<p>In the enthusiasm over the frigates in 1812, Congress
voted that six forty-fours should be built, besides
four ships-of-the-line. The Act was approved
Jan. 2, 1813. Not until March 3 did Congress pass
an Act for building six new sloops-of-war. The loss
of two months was not the only misfortune in this
legislation. Had the sloops been begun in January,
they might have gone to sea by the close of the year.
The six sloops were all launched within eleven months
from the passage of the bill, and the first of them, the
“Frolic,” got to sea within that time, while none of
the frigates or line-of-battle ships could get to sea
within two years of the passage of the law. A more
remarkable oversight was the building of only six
sloops, when an equal number of forty-fours and four<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span>
seventy-fours were ordered. Had Congress voted
twenty-four sloops, the proportion would not have
been improper; but perhaps the best policy would
have been to build fifty such sloops, and to prohibit
privateering. The reasons for such a course were
best seen in the experiences of the privateers.</p>

<p>The history of the privateers was never satisfactorily
written. Neither their number, their measurements,
their force, their captures, nor their losses
were accurately known. Little ground could be given
for an opinion in regard to their economy. Only with
grave doubt could any judgment be reached even in
regard to their relative efficiency compared with government
vessels of the same class. Yet their experience
was valuable, and their services were very
great.</p>

<p>In the summer of 1812 any craft that could keep
the sea in fine weather set out as a privateer to intercept
vessels approaching the coast. The typical
privateer of the first few months was the pilot-boat,
armed with one or two long-nine or twelve-pound
guns. Of twenty-six privateers sent from New York
in the first four months of war, fifteen carried crews
of eighty men or less. These small vessels especially
infested the West Indies, where fine weather and
light breezes suited their qualities. After the seas
had been cleared of such prey as these petty marauders
could manage, they were found to be unprofitable,—too
small to fight and too light to escape.
The typical privateer of 1813 was a larger vessel,—a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_315">315</span>
brig or schooner of two or three hundred tons, armed
with one long pivot-gun, and six or eight lighter
guns in broadside; carrying crews which varied in
number from one hundred and twenty to one hundred
and sixty men; swift enough to escape under most
circumstances even a frigate, and strong enough to
capture any armed merchantman.</p>

<p>After the war was fairly begun, the British mercantile
shipping always sailed either under convoy
or as armed “running ships” that did not wait for
the slow and comparatively rare opportunities of
convoy, but trusted to their guns for defence. The
new American privateer was adapted to meet both
chances. Two or three such craft hanging about a
convoy could commonly cut off some merchantman,
no matter how careful the convoying man-of-war
might be. By night they could run directly into the
fleet and cut out vessels without even giving an
alarm, and by day they could pick up any craft that
lagged behind or happened to stray too far away.
Yet the “running ships” were the chief objects of
their search, for these were the richest prizes; and
the capture of a single such vessel, if it reached
an American port in safety, insured success to the
cruise. The loss of these vessels caused peculiar
annoyance to the British, for they sometimes carried
considerable amounts of specie, and usually were
charged with a mail which was always sunk and lost
in case of capture.</p>

<p>As the war continued, experience taught the owners<span class="pagenum" id="Page_316">316</span>
of privateers the same lesson that was taught to
the government. The most efficient vessel of war
corresponded in size with the “Hornet” or the new
sloops-of-war building in 1813. Tonnage was so arbitrary
a mode of measurement that little could be
learned from the dimensions of five hundred tons
commonly given for these vessels; but in a general
way they might be regarded as about one hundred
and fifteen or one hundred and twenty feet long on
the spar-deck and thirty-one feet in extreme breadth.
Unless such vessels were swift sailers, particularly
handy in working to windward, they were worse than
useless; and for that reason the utmost effort was
made both by the public and private constructors to
obtain speed. At the close of the war the most
efficient vessel afloat was probably the American
sloop-of-war, or privateer, of four or five hundred
tons, rigged as a ship or brig, and carrying one
hundred and fifty or sixty men, with a battery varying
according to the ideas of the captain and owners,
but in the case of privateers almost invariably
including one “long Tom,” or pivot-gun.</p>

<p>Yet for privateering purposes the smaller craft
competed closely with the larger. For ordinary service
no vessel could do more effective work in a more
economical way than was done by Joshua Barney’s
“Rossie” of Baltimore, or Boyle’s “Comet” of the
same port, or Champlin’s “General Armstrong” of
New York,—schooners or brigs of two or three hundred
tons, uncomfortable to their officers and crews,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_317">317</span>
but most dangerous enemies to merchantmen. Vessels
of this class came into favor long before the
war, because of their speed, quickness in handling,
and economy during the experience of twenty years
in blockade-running and evasion of cruisers. Such
schooners could be built in any Northern sea-port
in six weeks or two months at half the cost of a
government cruiser.</p>

<p>The government sloop-of-war was not built for
privateering purposes. Every government vessel was
intended chiefly to fight, and required strength in
every part and solidity throughout. The frame
needed to be heavy to support the heavier structure;
the quarters needed to be thick to protect the men
at the guns from grape and musketry; the armament
was as weighty as the frame would bear. So strong
were the sides of American frigates that even thirty-two-pound
shot fired at forty or fifty feet distance
sometimes failed to penetrate, and the British complained
as a grievance that the sides of an American
forty-four were thicker than those of a British
seventy-four.<a id="FNanchor_429" href="#Footnote_429" class="fnanchor">429</a> The American ship-builders spared no
pains to make all their vessels in every respect—in
size, strength, and speed—superior to the vessels
with which they were to compete; but the government
ship-carpenter had a harder task than the private
ship-builder, for he was obliged to obtain greater
speed at the same time that he used heavier material
than the British constructors. As far as the navy<span class="pagenum" id="Page_318">318</span>
carpenters succeeded in their double object, they did
so by improving the model and increasing the proportions
of the spars.</p>

<p>The privateer was built for no such object. The
last purpose of a privateer was to fight at close range,
and owners much preferred that their vessels, being
built to make money, should not fight at all unless
much money could be made. The private armed vessel
was built rather to fly than to fight, and its value
depended far more on its ability to escape than on
its capacity to attack. If the privateer could sail
close to the wind, and wear or tack in the twinkling
of an eye; if she could spread an immense amount
of canvas and run off as fast as a frigate before the
wind; if she had sweeps to use in a calm, and one
long-range gun pivoted amidships, with plenty of men
in case boarding became necessary,—she was perfect.
To obtain these results the builders and sailors ran
excessive risks. Too lightly built and too heavily
sparred, the privateer was never a comfortable or a
safe vessel. Beautiful beyond anything then known
in naval construction, such vessels roused boundless
admiration, but defied imitators. British constructors
could not build them, even when they had the
models; British captains could not sail them; and
when British admirals, fascinated by their beauty and
tempted by the marvellous qualities of their model,
ordered such a prize to be taken into the service, the
first act of the carpenters in the British navy-yards
was to reduce to their own standard the long masts,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_319">319</span>
and to strengthen the hull and sides till the vessel
should be safe in a battle or a gale. Perhaps an
American navy-carpenter must have done the same;
but though not a line in the model might be altered,
she never sailed again as she sailed before. She
could not bear conventional restraints.</p>

<p>Americans were proud of their privateers, as they
well might be; for this was the first time when in
competition with the world, on an element open to
all, they proved their capacity to excel, and produced
a creation as beautiful as it was practical. The British
navy took a new tone in regard to these vessels.
Deeply as the American frigates and sloops-of-war
had wounded the pride of the British navy, they
never had reduced that fine service to admitted inferiority.
Under one pretext or another, every defeat
was excused. Even the superiority of American
gunnery was met by the proud explanation that
the British navy, since Trafalgar, had enjoyed no
opportunity to use their guns. Nothing could convince
a British admiral that Americans were better
fighters than Englishmen; but when he looked at the
American schooner he frankly said that England could
show no such models, and could not sail them if she
had them. In truth, the schooner was a wonderful
invention. Not her battles, but her escapes won for
her the open-mouthed admiration of the British captains,
who saw their prize double like a hare and slip
through their fingers at the moment when capture
was sure. Under any ordinary condition of wind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_320">320</span>
and weather, with an open sea, the schooner, if only
she could get to windward, laughed at a frigate.</p>

<p>As the sailing rather than the fighting qualities of
the privateer were the chief object of her construction,
those were the points best worth recording;
but the newspapers of the time were so much absorbed
in proving that Americans could fight, as to
cause almost total neglect of the more important
question whether Americans could sail better than
their rivals. All great nations had fought, and at
one time or another every great nation in Europe
had been victorious over every other; but no people,
in the course of a thousand years of rivalry on the
ocean, had invented or had known how to sail a
Yankee schooner. Whether ship, brig, schooner, or
sloop, the American vessel was believed to outsail
any other craft on the ocean, and the proof of this
superiority was incumbent on the Americans to furnish.
They neglected to do so. No clear evidence
was ever recorded of the precise capacities of their
favorite vessels. Neither the lines of the hull, the
dimensions of the spars, the rates of sailing by the
log in different weather, the points of sailing,—nothing
precise was ever set down.</p>

<p>Of the superiority no doubts could be entertained.
The best proof of the American claim was the British
admission. Hardly an English writer on marine
affairs—whether in newspapers, histories, or novels—failed
to make some allusion to the beauty and speed
of American vessels. The naval literature of Great<span class="pagenum" id="Page_321">321</span>
Britain from 1812 to 1860 was full of such material.
The praise of the invention was still commonly accompanied
by some expression of dislike for the inventor,
but even in that respect a marked change
followed the experiences of 1812–1814. Among the
Englishmen living on the island of Jamaica, and
familiar with the course of events in the West Indies
from 1806 to 1817, was one Michael Scott, born in
Glasgow in 1789, and in the prime of his youth at
the time of the American war. In the year 1829,
at the age of forty, he began the publication in
“Blackwood’s Magazine” of a series of sketches
which rapidly became popular as “Tom Cringle’s
Log.” Scott was the best narrator and probably the
best informed man who wrote on the West Indies at
that period; and his frequent allusions to the United
States and the war threw more light on the social
side of history than could be obtained from all official
sources ever printed.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I don’t like Americans,” Scott said; “I never did
and never shall like them. I have seldom met an American
gentleman in the large and complete sense of the
term. I have no wish to eat with them, drink with them,
deal with or consort with them in any way; but let me
tell the whole truth,—<em>nor fight</em> with them, were it not
for the laurels to be acquired by overcoming an enemy
so brave, determined, and alert, and every way so worthy
of one’s steel as they have always proved.”</p>
</div>

<p>The Americans did not fight the War of 1812 in
order to make themselves loved. According to Scott’s<span class="pagenum" id="Page_322">322</span>
testimony they gained the object for which they did
fight. “In gunnery and small-arm practice we were
as thoroughly weathered on by the Americans during
the war as we overtopped them in the bull-dog courage
with which our boarders handled those genuine
English weapons,—the cutlass and the pike.” Superiority
in the intellectual branches of warfare was
conceded to the Americans; but even in regard to
physical qualities, the British were not inclined to
boast.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“In the field,” said Scott, “or grappling in mortal
combat on the blood-slippery quarter-deck of an enemy’s
vessel, a British soldier or sailor is the bravest of the
brave. No soldier or sailor of any other country, saving
and excepting those damned Yankees, can stand against
them.”</p>
</div>

<p>Had English society known so much of Americans
in 1807, war would have been unnecessary.</p>

<p>Yet neither equality in physical courage nor superiority
in the higher branches of gunnery and small-arms
was the chief success of Americans in the war.
Beyond question the schooner was the most conclusive
triumph. Readers of Michael Scott could not
forget the best of his sketches,—the escape of the
little American schooner “Wave” from two British
cruisers, by running to windward under the broadside
of a man-of-war. With keen appreciation Scott detailed
every motion of the vessels, and dwelt with
peculiar emphasis on the apparent desperation of the
attempt. Again and again the thirty-two-pound shot,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_323">323</span>
as he described the scene, tore through the slight
vessel as the two crafts raced through the heavy seas
within musket-shot of one another, until at last the
firing from the corvette ceased. “The breeze had
taken off, and the ‘Wave,’ resuming her superiority
in light winds, had escaped.” Yet this was not the
most significant part of “Tom Cringle’s” experience.
The “Wave,” being afterward captured at anchor,
was taken into the royal service and fitted as a ship-of-war.
Cringle was ordered by the vice-admiral to
command her, and as she came to report he took a
look at <span class="locked">her:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“When I had last seen her she was a most beautiful
little craft, both in hull and rigging, as ever delighted
the eye of a sailor; but the dock-yard riggers and carpenters
had fairly bedevilled her, at least so far as appearances
went. First they had replaced the light rail
on her gunwale by heavy solid bulwarks four feet high,
surmounted by hammock nettings at least another foot;
so that the symmetrical little vessel that formerly floated
on the foam light as a sea-gull now looked like a clumsy,
dish-shaped Dutch dogger. Her long, slender wands of
masts which used to swing about as if there were neither
shrouds nor stays to support them were now as taut and
stiff as church-steeples, with four heavy shrouds of a
side, and stays and back-stays, and the Devil knows
what all.”</p>
</div>

<p>“If them heave-‘emtaughts at the yard have not
taken the speed out of the little beauty I am a
Dutchman” was the natural comment,—as obvious
as it was sound.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_324">324</span></p>

<p>The reports of privateer captains to their owners
were rarely published, and the logs were never
printed or deposited in any public office. Occasionally,
in the case of a battle or the loss of guns or
spars or cargo in a close pursuit, the privateer captain
described the causes of his loss in a letter
which found its way into print; and from such letters
some idea could be drawn of the qualities held
in highest regard, both in their vessels and in themselves.
The first and commonest remark was that
privateers of any merit never seemed to feel anxious
for their own safety so long as they could get to
windward a couple of gunshots from their enemy.
They would risk a broadside in the process without
very great anxiety. They chiefly feared lest they
might be obliged to run before the wind in heavy
weather. The little craft which could turn on itself
like a flash and dart away under a frigate’s guns
into the wind’s eye long before the heavy ship could
come about, had little to fear on that point of sailing;
but when she was obliged to run to leeward,
the chances were more nearly equal. Sometimes,
especially in light breezes or in a stronger wind, by
throwing guns and weighty articles overboard privateers
could escape; but in heavy weather the ship-of-war
could commonly outcarry them, and more often
could drive them on a coast or into the clutches of
some other man-of-war.</p>

<p>Of being forced to fly to leeward almost every privateer
could tell interesting stories. A fair example of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_325">325</span>
such tales was an adventure of Captain George Coggeshall,
who afterward compiled, chiefly from newspapers,
an account of the privateers, among which he
preserved a few stories that would otherwise have
been lost.<a id="FNanchor_430" href="#Footnote_430" class="fnanchor">430</a> Coggeshall commanded a two-hundred-ton
schooner, the “David Porter,” in which he made
the run to France with a cargo and a letter-of-marque.
The schooner was at Bordeaux in March, 1814, when
Wellington’s army approached. Afraid of seizure by
the British if he remained at Bordeaux, Coggeshall
sailed from Bordeaux for La Rochelle with a light
wind from the eastward, when at daylight March 15,
1814, he found a large ship about two miles to windward.
Coggeshall tried to draw his enemy down to
leeward, but only lost ground until the ship was not
more than two gunshots away. The schooner could
then not run to windward without taking the enemy’s
fire within pistol-shot, and dared not return to Bordeaux.
Nothing remained but to run before the wind.
Coggeshall got out his square-sail and studding-sails
ready to set, and when everything was prepared he
changed his course and bore off suddenly, gaining a
mile in the six or eight minutes lost by the ship in
spreading her studding-sails. He then started his
water-casks, threw out ballast, and drew away from
his pursuer, till in a few hours the ship became a
speck on the horizon.</p>

<p>Apparently a similar but narrower escape was made
by Captain Champlin of the “Warrior,” a famous<span class="pagenum" id="Page_326">326</span>
privateer-brig of four hundred and thirty tons, mounting
twenty-one guns and carrying one hundred and
fifty men.<a id="FNanchor_431" href="#Footnote_431" class="fnanchor">431</a> Standing for the harbor of Fayal, Dec.
15, 1814, he was seen by a British man-of-war lying
there at anchor. The enemy slipped her cables and
made sail in chase. The weather was very fresh and
squally, and at eight o’clock in the evening the ship
was only three miles distant. After a run of about
sixty miles, the man-of-war came within grape-shot
distance and opened fire from her two bow-guns.
Champlin luffed a little, got his long pivot-gun to
bear, and ran out his starboard guns as though to
fight, which caused the ship to shorten sail for battle.
Then Champlin at two o’clock in the morning
threw overboard eleven guns, and escaped. The
British ship was in sight the next morning, but did
not pursue farther.</p>

<p>Often the privateers were obliged to throw everything
overboard at the risk of capsizing, or escaped
capture only by means of their sweeps. In 1813
Champlin commanded the “General Armstrong,” a
brig of two hundred and forty-six tons and one hundred
and forty men. Off Surinam, March 11, 1813,
he fell in with the British sloop-of-war “Coquette,”
which he mistook for a letter-of-marque, and approached
with the intention of boarding. Having
come within pistol-shot and fired his broadsides, he
discovered his error. The wind was light, the two
vessels had no headway, and for three quarters of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_327">327</span>
hour, if Champlin’s account could be believed, he lay
within pistol-shot of the man-of-war. He was struck
by a musket-ball in the left shoulder; six of his
crew were killed and fourteen wounded; his rigging
was cut to pieces; his foremast and bowsprit injured,
and several shots entered the brig between wind
and water, causing her to leak; but at last he succeeded
in making sail forward, and with the aid of
his sweeps crept out of range. The sloop-of-war was
unable to cripple or follow him.<a id="FNanchor_432" href="#Footnote_432" class="fnanchor">432</a></p>

<p>Sometimes the very perfection of the privateer led
to dangers as great as though perfection were a
fault. Captain Shaler of the “Governor Tompkins,”
a schooner, companion to the “General Armstrong,”
chased three sail Dec. 25, 1812, and on near approach
found them to be two ships and a brig. The larger
ship had the appearance of a government transport;
she had boarding-nettings almost up to her tops, but
her ports appeared to be painted, and she seemed prepared
for running away as she fought. Shaler drew
nearer, and came to the conclusion that the ship was
too heavy for him; but while his first officer went
forward with the glass to take another look, a sudden
squall struck the schooner without reaching the
ship, and in a moment, before the light sails could be
taken in, “and almost before I could turn round, I
was under the guns, not of a transport, but of a large
frigate, and not more than a quarter of a mile from
her.” With impudence that warranted punishment,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_328">328</span>
Shaler fired his little broadside of nine or twelve
pounders into the enemy, who replied with a broadside
of twenty-four-pounders, killing three men, wounding
five, and causing an explosion on deck that threw
confusion into the crew; but the broadside did no
serious injury to the rigging. The schooner was then
just abaft the ship’s beam, a quarter of a mile away,
holding the same course and to windward. She could
not tack without exposing her stern to a raking fire,
and any failure to come about would have been certain
destruction. Shaler stood on, taking the ship’s
fire, on the chance of outsailing his enemy before a
shot could disable the schooner. Side by side the
two vessels raced for half an hour, while twenty-four-pound
shot fell in foam about the schooner, but never
struck her, and at last she drew ahead beyond range.
Even then her dangers were not at an end. A calm
followed; the ship put out boats; and only by throwing
deck-lumber and shot overboard, and putting all
hands at the sweeps, did Shaler “get clear of one
of the most quarrelsome companions that I ever met
with.”<a id="FNanchor_433" href="#Footnote_433" class="fnanchor">433</a></p>

<p>The capacities of the American privateer could to
some extent be inferred from its mishaps. Notwithstanding
speed, skill, and caution, the privateer was
frequently and perhaps usually captured in the end.
The modes of capture were numerous. April 3, 1813,
Admiral Warren’s squadron in the Chesapeake captured
by boats, after a sharp action, the privateer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_329">329</span>
“Dolphin” of Baltimore, which had taken refuge in
the Rappahannock River. April 27 the “Tom” of
Baltimore, a schooner of nearly three hundred tons,
carrying fourteen guns, was captured by his Majesty’s
ships “Surveillante” and “Lyra” after a smart
chase. Captain Collier of the “Surveillante” reported:
“She is a remarkably fine vessel of her
class, and from her superior sailing has already escaped
from eighteen of his Majesty’s cruisers.” May
11, the “Holkar” of New York was driven ashore
off Rhode Island and destroyed by the “Orpheus”
frigate. May 19, Captain Gordon of the British
man-of-war “Ratler,” in company with the schooner
“Bream,” drove ashore and captured the “Alexander”
of Salem, off Kennebunk, “considered the fastest
sailing privateer out of the United States,” according
to Captain Gordon’s report.<a id="FNanchor_434" href="#Footnote_434" class="fnanchor">434</a> May 21, Captain Hyde
Parker of the frigate “Tenedos,” in company with
the brig “Curlew,” captured the “Enterprise” of
Salem, pierced for eighteen guns. May 23, the “Paul
Jones,” of sixteen guns and one hundred and twenty
men, fell in with a frigate in a thick fog off the coast
of Ireland, and being crippled by her fire surrendered.
July 13, Admiral Cockburn captured by boats
at Ocracoke Inlet the fine privateer-brig “Anaconda”
of New York, with a smaller letter-of-marque. July
17, at sea, three British men-of-war, after a chase
of four hours, captured the “Yorktown” of twenty
guns and one hundred and forty men. The schooner<span class="pagenum" id="Page_330">330</span>
“Orders in Council” of New York, carrying sixteen
guns and one hundred and twenty men, was captured
during the summer, after a long chase of five days,
by three British cutters that drove her under the guns
of a frigate. The “Matilda,” privateer of eleven
guns and one hundred and four men, was captured
off San Salvador by attempting to board the British
letter-of-marque “Lyon” under the impression that
she was the weaker ship.</p>

<p>In these ten instances of large privateers captured
or destroyed in 1813, the mode of capture happened
to be recorded; and in none of them was the privateer
declared to have been outsailed and caught by
any single British vessel on the open seas. Modes of
disaster were many, and doubtless among the rest a
privateer might occasionally be fairly beaten in speed,
but few such cases were recorded, although British naval
officers were quick to mention these unusual victories.
Unless the weather gave to the heavier British
vessel-of-war the advantage of carrying more sail in
a rough sea, the privateer was rarely outsailed.</p>

<p>The number of privateers at sea in 1813 was not
recorded. The list of all private armed vessels during
the entire war included somewhat more than five
hundred names.<a id="FNanchor_435" href="#Footnote_435" class="fnanchor">435</a> Most of these were small craft,
withdrawn after a single cruise. Not two hundred
were so large as to carry crews of fifty men. Nearly
two hundred and fifty, or nearly half the whole
number of privateers, fell into British hands. Probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_331">331</span>
at no single moment were more than fifty seagoing
vessels on the ocean as privateers, and the
number was usually very much less; while the large
privateer-brigs or ships that rivalled sloops-of-war
in size were hardly more numerous than the sloops
themselves.</p>

<p>The total number of prizes captured from the British
in 1813 exceeded four hundred, four fifths of
which were probably captured by privateers, national
cruisers taking only seventy-nine. If the privateers
succeeded in taking three hundred and fifty prizes,
the whole number of privateers could scarcely have
exceeded one hundred. The government cruisers
“President,” “Congress,” “Chesapeake,” “Hornet,”
and “Argus” averaged nearly ten prizes apiece. Privateers
averaged much less; but they were ten times
as numerous as the government cruisers, and inflicted
four times as much injury.</p>

<p>Such an addition to the naval force of the United
States was very important. Doubtless the privateers
contributed more than the regular navy to bring
about a disposition for peace in the British classes
most responsible for the war. The colonial and
shipping interests, whose influence produced the Orders
in Council, suffered the chief penalty. The West
India colonies were kept in constant discomfort and
starvation by swarms of semi-piratical craft darting
in and out of every channel among their islands;
but the people of England could have borne with
patience the punishment of the West Indies had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_332">332</span>
the American cruisers inflicted equally severe retribution
nearer home.</p>

<p>Great Britain was blockaded. No one could deny
that manifest danger existed to any merchant-vessel
that entered or left British waters. During the
summer the blockade was continuous. Toward the
close of 1812 an American named Preble, living in
Paris, bought a small vessel, said to have belonged
in turn to the British and French navy, which he
fitted as a privateer-brig, carrying sixteen guns and
one hundred and sixty men. The “True-Blooded
Yankee,” commanded by Captain Hailey, sailed from
Brest March 1, 1813, and cruised thirty-seven days
on the coasts of Ireland and Scotland, capturing
twenty-seven valuable vessels; sinking coasters in
the very bay of Dublin; landing and taking possession
of an island off the coast of Ireland, and of a
town in Scotland, where she burned seven vessels
in the harbor. She returned safely to Brest, and
soon made another cruise. At the same time the
schooner “Fox” of Portsmouth burned or sunk vessel
after vessel in the Irish Sea, as they plied between
Liverpool and Cork. In May, the schooner “Paul
Jones” of New York, carrying sixteen guns and one
hundred and twenty men, took or destroyed a dozen
vessels off the Irish coast, until she was herself
caught in a fog by the frigate “Leonidas,” and captured
May 23 after a chase in which five of her crew
were wounded.</p>

<p>While these vessels were thus engaged, the brig<span class="pagenum" id="Page_333">333</span>
“Rattlesnake” of Philadelphia, carrying sixteen guns
and one hundred and twenty men, and the brig
“Scourge” of New York, carrying nine guns and one
hundred and ten men, crossed the ocean and cruised
all the year in the northern seas off the coasts of
Scotland and Norway, capturing some forty British
vessels, and costing the British merchants and ship-owners
losses to the amount of at least two million
dollars. In July the “Scourge” fell in with Commodore
Rodgers in the “President,” and the two vessels
remained several days in company off the North
Cape, while the British admiralty sent three or four
squadrons in search of them without success. July
19, after Rodgers had been nearly a month in British
waters, one of these squadrons drove him away, and
he then made a circuit round Ireland before he turned
homeward. At the same time, from July 14 to August
14, the “Argus” was destroying vessels in the
British Channel at the rate of nearly one a day. After
the capture of the “Argus,” August 14, the “Grand
Turk” of Salem, a brig carrying sixteen guns and
one hundred and five men, cruised for twenty days
in the mouth of the British Channel without being
disturbed. Besides these vessels, others dashed into
British waters from time to time as they sailed forward
and back across the ocean in the track of
British commerce.</p>

<p>No one disputed that the privateers were a very
important branch of the American navy; but they
suffered under serious drawbacks, which left doubtful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_334">334</span>
the balance of merits and defects. Perhaps their
chief advantage compared with government vessels
was their lightness,—a quality which no government
would have carried to the same extent. The long-range
pivot-gun was another invention of the privateer,
peculiarly successful and easily adapted for
government vessels. In other respects, the same
number or even half the number of sloops-of-war
would have probably inflicted greater injury at less
cost. The “Argus” showed how this result could
have been attained. The privateer’s first object was
to save prizes; and in the effort to send captured
vessels into port the privateer lost a large proportion
by recapture. Down to the moment when Admiral
Warren established his blockade of the American
coast from New York southward, most of the prizes
got to port. After that time the New England ports
alone offered reasonable chance of safety, and privateering
received a check.<a id="FNanchor_436" href="#Footnote_436" class="fnanchor">436</a> During the war about
twenty-five hundred vessels all told were captured
from the British. Many were destroyed; many released
as cartels; and of the remainder not less
than seven hundred and fifty, probably one half the
number sent to port, were recaptured by the British
navy. Most of these were the prizes of privateers,
and would have been destroyed had they been taken
by government vessels. They were usually the most
valuable prizes, so that the injury that might have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_335">335</span>
been inflicted on British commerce was diminished
nearly one half by the system which encouraged
private war as a money-making speculation.</p>

<p>Another objection was equally serious. Like all
gambling ventures, privateering was not profitable.
In the list of five hundred privateers furnished by the
Navy Department,<a id="FNanchor_437" href="#Footnote_437" class="fnanchor">437</a> three hundred were recorded as
having never made a prize. Of the remainder, few
made their expenses. One of the most successful
cruises of the war was that of Joshua Barney on the
Baltimore schooner “Rossie” at the outbreak of hostilities,
when every prize reached port. Barney sent
in prizes supposed to be worth fifteen hundred thousand
dollars; but after paying charges and duties
and selling the goods, he found that the profits were
not sufficient to counterbalance the discomforts, and
he refused to repeat the experiment. His experience
was common. As early as November, 1812, the owners
of twenty-four New York privateers sent to Congress
a memorial declaring that the profits of private
naval war were by no means equal to the hazards,
and that the spirit of privateering stood in danger
of extinction unless the government would consent
in some manner to grant a bounty for the capture
or destruction of the enemy’s property.</p>

<p>If private enterprise was to fail at the critical
moment, and if the government must supply the deficiency,
the government would have done better to
undertake the whole task. In effect, the government<span class="pagenum" id="Page_336">336</span>
in the end did so. The merchants asked chiefly for a
reduction of duties on prize-goods. Gallatin pointed
out the serious objections to such legislation, and the
little probability that the measure would increase the
profits of privateering or the number of privateers.
The actual privateers, he said, were more than enough
for the food offered by the enemy’s trade, and privateering,
like every other form of gambling, would
always continue to attract more adventurers than it
could support.<a id="FNanchor_438" href="#Footnote_438" class="fnanchor">438</a></p>

<p>Congress for the time followed Gallatin’s advice,
and did nothing; but in the summer session of 1813,
after Gallatin’s departure for Europe, the privateer
owners renewed their appeal, and the acting Secretary
of the Treasury, Jones, wrote to the chairman of the
Naval Committee July 21, <span class="locked">1813,<a id="FNanchor_439" href="#Footnote_439" class="fnanchor">439</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The fact is that ... privateering is nearly at an
end; and from the best observation I have been enabled
to make, it is more from the deficiency of remuneration
in the net proceeds of their prizes than from the vigilance
and success of the enemy in recapturing.”</p>
</div>

<p>In deference to Jones’s opinion, Congress passed an
Act, approved Aug. 2, 1813, reducing one third the
duties on prize-goods. Another Act, approved August
3, granted a bounty of twenty-five dollars for
every prisoner captured and delivered to a United
States agent by a private armed vessel. A third Act,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_337">337</span>
approved August 2, authorized the Secretary of the
Navy to place on the pension list any privateersman
who should be wounded or disabled in the line of
his duty.</p>

<p>These complaints and palliations tended to show
that the privateer cost the public more than the equivalent
government vessel would have cost. If instead
of five hundred privateers of all sizes and efficiency,
the government had kept twenty sloops-of-war constantly
at sea destroying the enemy’s commerce, the
result would have been about the same as far as concerned
injury to the enemy, while in another respect
the government would have escaped one of its chief
difficulties. Nothing injured the navy so much as
privateering. Seamen commonly preferred the harder
but more profitable and shorter cruise in a privateer,
where fighting was not expected or wished, to the
strict discipline and murderous battles of government
ships, where wages were low and prize-money scarce.
Of all towns in the United States, Marblehead was
probably the most devoted to the sea; but of nine
hundred men from Marblehead who took part in the
war, fifty-seven served as soldiers, one hundred and
twenty entered the navy, while seven hundred and
twenty-six went as privateersmen.<a id="FNanchor_440" href="#Footnote_440" class="fnanchor">440</a> Only after much
delay and difficulty could the frigates obtain crews.
The “Constitution” was nearly lost by this cause at
the beginning of the war; and the loss of the “Chesapeake”
was supposed to be chiefly due to the determination<span class="pagenum" id="Page_338">338</span>
of the old crew to quit the government
service for that of the privateers.</p>

<p>Such drawbacks raised reasonable doubts as to the
balance of advantages and disadvantages offered by
the privateer system. Perhaps more careful inquiry
might show that, valuable as the privateers were, the
government would have done better to retain all military
and naval functions in its own hands, and to
cover the seas with small cruisers capable of pursuing
a system of thorough destruction against the shipping
and colonial interests of England.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Gallatin</span> and Bayard, having sailed from the Delaware
May 9, arrived at St. Petersburg July 21, only
to find that during the six months since the Czar
offered to mediate, Russia had advanced rapidly in
every direction except that of the proposed mediation.
Napoleon after being driven from Russia in
December, 1812, passed the winter in Paris organizing
a new army of three hundred thousand men on
the Elbe, between Dresden and Magdeburg, while a
second army of more than one hundred thousand
was to hold Hamburg and Bremen. Russia could
not prevent Napoleon from reconstructing a force almost
as powerful as that with which he had marched
to Moscow, for the Russian army had suffered very
severely and was unfit for active service; but the
Czar succeeded in revolutionizing Prussia, and in
forcing the French to retire from the Vistula to the
Elbe, while he gained a reinforcement of more than
one hundred thousand men from the fresh and vigorous
Prussian army. Even with that assistance the
Czar could not cope with Napoleon, who, leaving
Paris April 17, during the month of May fought furious<span class="pagenum" id="Page_340">340</span>
battles at Lützen and Bautzen, which forced the
allied Russian and Prussian armies back from the
Elbe to the Oder.</p>

<p>At that point Austria interfered so energetically as
to oblige Napoleon to accept an armistice for the purpose
of collecting new forces. During the armistice
the Czar stationed himself at Gitschin in Bohemia,
nine hundred miles from St. Petersburg, and about the
same distance from London by the path that couriers
were obliged to take. When Gallatin and Bayard
reached St. Petersburg, July 21, the armistice, which
had been prolonged until August 10, was about to
expire, and the Czar could not be anxious to decide
subordinate questions until the issue of the coming
campaign should be known.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the government of England had in
May, with many friendly expressions, declined the
Russian mediation.<a id="FNanchor_441" href="#Footnote_441" class="fnanchor">441</a> Castlereagh probably hoped that
this quiet notification to Lieven, the Russian envoy
in London, would end the matter; but toward the
month of July news reached London that the American
commissioners, Gallatin and Bayard, had arrived
at Gothenburg on their way to Russia, and Castlereagh
then saw that he must be more explicit in his
refusal. Accordingly he took measures for making
the matter clear not only to the Russian government
but also to the American commissioners.</p>

<p>With the Russian government he was obliged by
the nature of their common relations to communicate<span class="pagenum" id="Page_341">341</span>
officially, and he wrote instructions to Lord
Cathcart, dated July 5, directing communication to
be made.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am afraid,” said Castlereagh’s letter,<a id="FNanchor_442" href="#Footnote_442" class="fnanchor">442</a> “this tender
of mediation which on a question of maritime right cannot
be listened to by Great Britain, however kindly and
liberally intended, will have had the unfortunate effect of
protracting the war with the United States. It is to be
lamented that the formal offer was made to America before
the disposition of the British government was previously
sounded as to its acceptance of a mediation. It has enabled
the President to hold out to the people of America
a vague expectation of peace, under which he may reconcile
them with less repugnance to submit to the measures
of the Government. This evil, however, cannot now
be avoided, and it only remains to prevent this question
from producing any embarrassment between Great
Britain and Russia.”</p>
</div>

<p>Embarrassment between Great Britain and Russia
was no new thing in European politics, and commonly
involved maritime objects for which the United
States were then fighting. Castlereagh had much
reason for wishing to avoid the danger. The most
fortunate result he could reasonably expect from
the coming campaign was a defeat of Bonaparte that
should drive him back to the Rhine. Then Russia
and Austria would probably offer terms to Napoleon;
England would be obliged to join in a European Congress;
Napoleon would raise the question of maritime<span class="pagenum" id="Page_342">342</span>
rights, and on that point he would be supported
by Russian sympathies. Napoleon and Russia might
insist that the United States should take part in the
Congress, and in that case England might be obliged
to retire from it. Castlereagh felt uneasy at the
prospect, and ordered Cathcart to “press the Emperor
of Russia in the strongest manner not to
push his personal interference on this point further.”
Cathcart was to use his utmost endeavors
to persuade the Czar “pointedly to discountenance
a design so mischievously calculated to promote the
views of France.”</p>

<p>Another week of reflection only increased Castlereagh’s
anxieties, and caused the British government
to take a step intended to leave the Czar no opening
for interference. July 13 Castlereagh wrote Cathcart
new instructions,<a id="FNanchor_443" href="#Footnote_443" class="fnanchor">443</a> directing him to present a
formal note acquainting the Czar that the Prince
Regent was “ready immediately to name plenipotentiaries
to meet and treat with the American
plenipotentiaries in the earnest desire” of peace,
either in London or at Gothenburg; although he
could “not consent that these discussions should be
carried on in any place which might be supposed
to imply that they were in any way connected with
any other negotiations.” He wrote privately to
Cathcart that the mere knowledge of the intervention
of a third power in any arrangement with the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_343">343</span>
United States would probably decide the British
people against it.<a id="FNanchor_444" href="#Footnote_444" class="fnanchor">444</a></p>

<p>Thus in July, 1813, when the war was barely a
year old, Castlereagh reached the point of offering
to negotiate directly with the United States. This
advantage was gained by the Russian offer of mediation,
and was intended not to pacify America but to
silence Alexander and Roumanzoff. Castlereagh was
frank and prompt in his declarations. His offer of
direct negotiation was dated July 13, at a time when
Alexander Baring received a letter from Gallatin announcing
his arrival at Gothenburg and inviting assistance
for the proposed mediation. Baring consulted
Castlereagh, and wrote, July 22, a long letter to Gallatin,
to inform the American commissioners what the
British government had done and was willing to do.
“Before this reaches you,” said Baring,<a id="FNanchor_445" href="#Footnote_445" class="fnanchor">445</a> “you will
have been informed that this mediation has been
refused, with expressions of our desire to treat
separately and directly here; or, if more agreeable
to you, at Gothenburg.” To leave no room for misunderstanding,
Baring added that if the American
commissioners were obliged by their instructions to
adhere pertinaciously to the American demands in
respect to impressments, he should think negotiation
useless.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_344">344</span></p>

<p>In regular succession all these expressions of British
policy were received at St. Petersburg in the Czar’s
absence, and in the doubtful state of mind which followed
the battles of Lützen and Bautzen. Alexander
had left Count Roumanzoff at St. Petersburg, continuing
to act as Chancellor of the Empire and Foreign Secretary;
but in truth the Minister of Foreign Affairs,
as far as the Czar then required such an officer, was
Count Nesselrode, who attended Alexander in person
and received his orders orally. Nesselrode at that
time was rather an agent than an adviser; but in
general he represented the English alliance and hostility
to Napoleon, while Roumanzoff represented the
French alliance and hostility to England.</p>

<p>Of English diplomacy Americans knew something,
and could by similarity of mind divine what was
not avowed. Of French diplomacy they had long
experience, and their study was rendered from time
to time more easy by Napoleon’s abrupt methods. Of
Russian diplomacy they knew little or nothing. Thus
far Minister Adams had been given his own way.
He had been allowed to seem to kindle the greatest
war of modern times, and had been invited to make
use of Russia against England; but the Czar’s reasons
for granting such favor were mysterious even to
Adams, for while Napoleon occasionally avowed motives,
Alexander never did. Russian diplomacy moved
wholly in the dark.</p>

<p>Only one point was certain. For reasons of his
own, the Czar chose to leave Roumanzoff nominally<span class="pagenum" id="Page_345">345</span>
in office until the result of the war should be decided,
although Roumanzoff was opposed to the Czar’s policy.
The chancellor did not stand alone in his hostility
to the war; probably a majority of the Russian
people shared the feeling. Even the army and its
old General Koutousoff, though elated with an immense
triumph, grumbled at being obliged to fight
the battles of Germany, and would gladly have returned
to their own soil. The Czar himself could not
afford to break his last tie with the French interest,
but was wise to leave a path open by which he
could still retreat in case his war in Germany failed.
If Napoleon should succeed once more in throwing
the Russian army back upon Russian soil, Alexander
might still be obliged to use Roumanzoff’s services
if not to resume his policy. Such a suspicion might
not wholly explain Alexander’s course toward Roumanzoff
and Koutousoff, but no one could doubt that
it explained the chancellor’s course toward the Czar.
Indeed, Roumanzoff made little concealment of his
situation or his hopes. Adams could without much
difficulty divine that the failure of the Czar in Germany
would alone save Roumanzoff in St. Petersburg,
and that the restoration of Roumanzoff to power was
necessary to reinvigorate the mediation.</p>

<p>Castlereagh’s first positive refusal to accept the
mediation was notified to Count Lieven in May, and
was known to Roumanzoff in St. Petersburg about the
middle of June. Early in July the Czar received it,
and by his order Nesselrode, in a despatch to Lieven<span class="pagenum" id="Page_346">346</span>
dated July 9, expressed “the perfect satisfaction
which his Imperial Majesty felt in the reasons which
actuated the conduct of this [British] government on
a point of so much delicacy and importance.”<a id="FNanchor_446" href="#Footnote_446" class="fnanchor">446</a> The
Czar was then in the midst of difficulties. The result
of the war was doubtful, and depended on Austria.</p>

<p>Just as news of the armistice arrived in St. Petersburg,
Minister Adams went to Roumanzoff, June
22, to inform him of Gallatin’s and Bayard’s appointment.
Roumanzoff in return gave Adams explicit
information of England’s refusal to accept the
Czar’s offer. Adams immediately recorded it in his
<span class="locked">Diary:<a id="FNanchor_447" href="#Footnote_447" class="fnanchor">447</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He [Roumanzoff] said that he was very sorry to say
he had received since he had seen me [June 15] further
despatches from Count Lieven, stating that the British
government, with many very friendly and polite assurances
that there was no mediation which they should so
readily and cheerfully accept as that of the Emperor of
Russia, had however stated that their differences with the
United States of America involving certain principles of
the internal government of England were of a nature
which they did not think suitable to be settled by a
mediation.”</p>
</div>

<p>Adams expected this answer, and at once assumed
it to be final; but Roumanzoff checked him.
“It would now be for consideration,” he continued,
“whether, after the step thus taken by the American<span class="pagenum" id="Page_347">347</span>
government [in sending commissioners to St. Petersburg],
it would not be advisable to renew the proposition
to Great Britain; upon which he should write
to the Emperor.” Not because of any American request,
but wholly of his own motion, Roumanzoff proposed
to keep the mediation alive. His motives were
for Adams to fathom. The chancellor did not avow
them, but he hinted to Adams that the chances of
war were many. “Perhaps it might be proper not
to be discouraged by the ill success of his first advances.
After considerations might produce more
pacific dispositions in the British government. Unexpected
things were happening every day; ‘and in
our own affairs,’ said the count, ‘a very general report
prevails that an armistice has taken place.’” A
Congress had been proposed, and the United States
were expressly named among the Powers to be invited
to it.</p>

<p>Adams reported this conversation to his Government
in a despatch dated June 26,<a id="FNanchor_448" href="#Footnote_448" class="fnanchor">448</a> and waited for his
two new colleagues, who arrived July 21. Personally
the colleagues were agreeable to Adams, and the proposed
negotiation was still more so, for the President
sent him official notice that in case the negotiations
were successful, Adams’s services would be
required as minister in London; but with the strongest
inducements to press the mediation, Adams could
not but see that he and his colleagues depended on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_348">348</span>
Roumanzoff, and that Roumanzoff depended not on
Alexander, but on Napoleon. Roumanzoff’s only
chance of aiding them was by clinging to office until
the Czar should be weary of war.</p>

<p>Unwilling as Gallatin was to be thus made the
sport of imperial policy, he was obliged, like his colleagues,
to submit. Two days after their arrival,
Roumanzoff told them that he meant, if possible, to
begin the whole transaction anew.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The count said he regretted much that there was
such reason to believe the British would decline the
mediation; but on transmitting the copy of the credential
letter to the Emperor, he would determine whether to
renew the proposal, as the opposition in England might
make it an embarrassing charge against the Ministry if
they should under such circumstances reject it.”<a id="FNanchor_449" href="#Footnote_449" class="fnanchor">449</a></p>
</div>

<p>Roumanzoff had written soon after June 22 to ask
the Czar whether, on the arrival of the American
commissioners, the offer of mediation should be renewed.
The Czar, overwhelmed with business, wrote
back, about July 20, approving Roumanzoff’s suggestion,
and authorizing him to send a despatch directly
to Count Lieven in London renewing the offer. The
Czar’s letter was communicated to Adams August 10<a id="FNanchor_450" href="#Footnote_450" class="fnanchor">450</a>
by Roumanzoff, who was evidently much pleased and
perhaps somewhat excited by it.</p>

<p>Such a letter warranted some excitement, for Roumanzoff
could regard it only as a sign of hesitation<span class="pagenum" id="Page_349">349</span>
and anxiety. Alexander was in a degree pledged to
England to press the mediation no further. While
he assured England through Nesselrode, July 9, that
he was perfectly satisfied with the British reasons
for refusing his offer of mediation “on a point of so
much delicacy and importance,” he authorized Roumanzoff
only ten days afterward to annoy England a
second time with an offer which he had every reason
to know must be rejected; and he did this without
informing Nesselrode.</p>

<p>Gallatin and Bayard found themselves, August 10,
condemned to wait two or three months for the British
answer, which they knew must be unfavorable,
because Gallatin received August 17 Baring’s letter
announcing the determination of Castlereagh to negotiate
separately. Roumanzoff’s conduct became
more and more mysterious to the commissioners.
He did not notify them of Castlereagh’s official offer
to negotiate directly. He confounded Adams, August
19, by flatly denying his own information, given two
months before, that England rejected mediation in
principle because it involved doctrines of her internal
government. Roumanzoff insisted that England
had never refused to accept the mediation, although
he held in his hands at least two despatches from
Lieven, written as late as July 13, officially communicating
England’s determination to negotiate directly
or not at all. Castlereagh, foreseeing the possibility
of misunderstanding, had read to Lieven the instructions
of July 13 for communication to Roumanzoff,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_350">350</span>
besides authorizing Cathcart to show them <i lang="la">in extenso</i>
to the Czar.<a id="FNanchor_451" href="#Footnote_451" class="fnanchor">451</a> In denying that such instructions had
been given, Roumanzoff could not have expected the
American commissioners to believe him.</p>

<p>The motive of Roumanzoff’s persistence might be
open to the simple explanation that the chancellor
hoped to recover power, and within a few months to
re-establish his policy of antagonism to England.
Alexander’s conduct could be explained by no such
obvious interest. When Castlereagh’s letters of July
13 and 14 reached Cathcart at the Czar’s headquarters
in Bohemia about August 10, they arrived at the
most critical moment of the war. On that day the
armistice expired. The next day Austria declared
war on Napoleon. The combined armies of Russia,
Prussia, and Austria concentrated behind the mountains,
and then marched into Saxony. While starting
on that campaign, August 20, the Czar was told by
Lord Cathcart the reasons why his offer of mediation
was rejected, and answered at once that in this
case he could do nothing more.<a id="FNanchor_452" href="#Footnote_452" class="fnanchor">452</a> Cathcart wrote to
Nesselrode a formal note on the subject August 23 or
24, but did not at once communicate it,<a id="FNanchor_453" href="#Footnote_453" class="fnanchor">453</a> because the
campaign had then begun; the great battle of Dresden
was fought August 26 and 27, and the allies,
again beaten, retired into Bohemia August 28. The<span class="pagenum" id="Page_351">351</span>
Czar saw his best military adviser Moreau killed by
his side at Dresden, and he returned to Töplitz in
no happy frame of mind.</p>

<p>At Töplitz, September 1, Cathcart delivered to Nesselrode
his formal note,<a id="FNanchor_454" href="#Footnote_454" class="fnanchor">454</a> refusing Russian mediation
and communicating the offer of England to negotiate
directly. In an ordinary condition of government
Nesselrode should have taken care that the British
note should be made known without delay to the
American commissioners at St. Petersburg, but the
Czar kept in his own hands the correspondence with
Roumanzoff and the Americans, and neither he nor
Nesselrode communicated Cathcart’s act to Roumanzoff.<a id="FNanchor_455" href="#Footnote_455" class="fnanchor">455</a>
Possibly their silence was due to the new
military movements. August 29 the French marshal
Vandamme with forty thousand men, pursuing the
allies into Bohemia, was caught between the Prussians
and Austrians August 30 and crushed. During the
month of September severe fighting, favorable to the
allies, occurred, but no general advance was made by
the allied sovereigns.</p>

<p>Alexander next received at Töplitz toward September
20 a letter from Roumanzoff enclosing a renewal
of the offer of mediation, to be proposed in a despatch
to Lieven, read by Roumanzoff to the American commissioners
August 24, and sent to London August 28.
The Czar must have known the futility of this new
step, as well as the mistake into which Roumanzoff<span class="pagenum" id="Page_352">352</span>
had been led, and the awkward attitude of the American
commissioners. Only a fortnight before, he had
received Cathcart’s official note, and a few days earlier
he had assured Cathcart that he should do no more
in the matter. Yet, September 20, Alexander wrote
with his own hand a note of four lines to Roumanzoff,
approving his despatch to Lieven, and begging him to
follow up the affair as he had begun it.<a id="FNanchor_456" href="#Footnote_456" class="fnanchor">456</a></p>

<p>The Czar’s letter of September 20 completed the
embroglio, which remained unintelligible to every one
except himself. Cathcart was the most mystified of
all the victims to the Czar’s double attitude. At the
time when Alexander thus for the second time authorized
Roumanzoff to disregard the express entreaties
of the British government, Cathcart was making
an effort to explain to Castlereagh the Czar’s first
interference. If Castlereagh understood his minister’s
ideas, he was gifted with more than common
penetration.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I believe the not communicating the rescript of the
Emperor concerning the American plenipotentiaries to
have been the effect of accident,” wrote Cathcart<a id="FNanchor_457" href="#Footnote_457" class="fnanchor">457</a> from
Töplitz September 25; “but what is singular is that
notwithstanding his [Nesselrode’s] letter of the ninth
[July], by the Emperor’s command, to Count Lieven, this
communication from and instruction to Roumanzoff was
not known to Count Nesselrode till this day, when I
mentioned it to him, having received no caution to do<span class="pagenum" id="Page_353">353</span>
otherwise, and he was not at all pleased with it. It
was during the advance to Dresden. But I cannot help
thinking that there must have been some policy of Roumanzoff’s
stated in regard to keeping hold of the mediation,
which, whether it was detailed or not, would not
escape the Emperor’s penetration, and upon which he
may have been induced to act as far as sanctioning the
proposal of treating at <i>London</i> under Russia’s mediation,
which the Prince Regent’s government might accept or
reject as they pleased; and that not wishing to go at
that time into a discussion of maritime rights with either
Nesselrode or me, he afterward forgot it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Cathcart’s style was involved, but his perplexity
was evident. His remarks related only to the Czar’s
first letter to Roumanzoff, written about July 20, not
“during the advance to Dresden.” He knew nothing
of the Czar’s second letter to Roumanzoff, dated
September 20, renewing the same authority, only five
days before Cathcart’s labored attempt to explain the
first. Of the second letter, as of the first, neither
Nesselrode nor Cathcart was informed.</p>

<p>The Czar’s motive in thus ordering each of his two
ministers to act in ignorance and contradiction of
the other’s instructions perplexed Roumanzoff as it
did Cathcart. Lieven first revealed to Roumanzoff
the strange misunderstanding by positively refusing
to present to Castlereagh the chancellor’s note of
August 28 renewing the offer of mediation. Roumanzoff
was greatly mortified. He told Gallatin that
the mediation had been originally the Czar’s own
idea; that it had been the subject of repeated discussions<span class="pagenum" id="Page_354">354</span>
at his own motion, and had been adopted
notwithstanding Roumanzoff’s hints at the possibility
of English reluctance.<a id="FNanchor_458" href="#Footnote_458" class="fnanchor">458</a> The chancellor sent Lieven’s
despatch immediately to the Czar without comment,
requesting the Czar to read it and give his orders.
The British officials, unwilling to blame Alexander,
attacked Roumanzoff. Lord Walpole, who came directly
from Bohemia to St. Petersburg to act as
British ambassador, said “he was as sure as he
was of his own existence, and he believed he could
prove it, that Roumanzoff had been cheating us all.”<a id="FNanchor_459" href="#Footnote_459" class="fnanchor">459</a>
Cathcart wrote, December 12, to <span class="locked">Castlereagh,—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I think Nesselrode knows nothing of the delay of
communicating with the American mission; that it was
an intrigue of the chancellor’s, if it is one; and that
during the operations of war the Emperor lost the clew
to it, so that something has been unanswered.”<a id="FNanchor_460" href="#Footnote_460" class="fnanchor">460</a></p>
</div>

<p>Perhaps the Czar’s conduct admitted of several
interpretations. He might wish to keep the mediation
alive in order to occupy Roumanzoff until the
campaign should be decided; or he might in his good
nature prefer to gratify his old favorite by allowing
him to do what he wished; or he took this method
of signifying to Roumanzoff his disgrace and the
propriety of immediate retirement. Apparently Roumanzoff
took the last view, for he sent his resignation
to the Czar, and at the close of the year quitted his<span class="pagenum" id="Page_355">355</span>
official residence at the Department of Foreign Affairs,
telling Gallatin that he remained in office only
till he should receive authority to close the American
mission.</p>

<p>The American commissioners in private resented
Alexander’s treatment, but were unable to leave Russia
without authority. Gallatin learned, October 19,
that the Senate had refused to confirm his appointment,
but he remained at St. Petersburg, chiefly in
deference to Roumanzoff’s opinion, and probably with
ideas of assisting the direct negotiation at London
or elsewhere. Meanwhile the campaign was decided,
October 18, by Napoleon’s decisive overthrow at
Leipzig, which forced him to retreat behind the
Rhine. Still the Czar wrote nothing to Roumanzoff,
and the American commissioners remained month
after month at St. Petersburg. Not until Jan. 25,
1814, did Gallatin and Bayard begin their winter journey
to Amsterdam, where they arrived March 4 and
remained a month. Then Gallatin received, through
Baring, permission to enter England, and crossed the
Channel to hasten if he could the direct negotiation
which Castlereagh had offered and Madison
accepted.</p>

<p>The diplomatic outlook had changed since March,
1813, when the President accepted the offer of
Russian mediation; but the change was wholly for
the worse. England’s triumphs girdled the world,
and found no check except where Perry’s squadron
blocked the way to Detroit. The allied armies crossed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_356">356</span>
the Rhine in December and entered France on the
east. At the same time Wellington after a long campaign
drove Joseph from Spain, and entering France
from the south pressed against Bordeaux. The government
and people of England, in their excitement
and exultation at daily conquests, thought as little
as they could of the American war. Society rarely
mentioned it. Newspapers alone preserved a record
of British feelings toward the United States during
the year 1813. The expressions of newspapers, like
those of orators, could not be accepted without allowance,
for they aimed at producing some desired
effect, and said either more or less than the truth;
as a rule, they represented the cool opinion neither
of the person who uttered nor of the audience who
heard them; but in the absence of other records,
public opinion was given only in the press, and the
London newspapers alone furnished evidence of its
character.</p>

<p>The “Morning Chronicle”—the only friend of the
United States in the daily press of England—showed
its friendship by silence. Whatever the liberal opposition
thought in private, no one but Cobbett ventured
in public to oppose the war. Cobbett having become
a radical at the time of life when most men become
conservative, published in his “Weekly Register”
many columns of vigorous criticism on the American
war without apparent effect, although in truth he expressed
opinions commonly held by intelligent people.
Even Lord Castlereagh, Cobbett’s antipathy, shared<span class="pagenum" id="Page_357">357</span>
some of Cobbett’s least popular opinions in the matter
of the American war.</p>

<p>English society, whatever shades of diversity might
exist, was frank and free in expressing indifference
or contempt. Of the newspapers which made a duty
of reflecting what was believed to be the prevailing
public opinion, the “Times,” supposed to favor the
interests of Wellesley and Canning, was probably
the ablest. During the early part of the war, the
“Times” showed a disposition to criticise the Ministry
rather than the Americans. From the “Times”
came most of the bitter complaints, widely copied by
the American press, of the naval defeats suffered
by the “Guerriere,” the “Java,” and the “Macedonian.”
British successes were belittled, and abuse
of Americans was exaggerated, in order to deprive
ministers of credit. “The world has seen President
Madison plunge into a war from the basest motives,
and conduct it with the most entire want of ability,”
said the “Times” of February 9, 1813. “The
American government has sounded the lowest depth
of military disgrace, insomuch that the official records
of the campaign take from us all possibility
of exulting in our victories over such an enemy.”
The “Times” found in such reflections a reason
for not exulting in ministerial victories, but it bewailed
defeats the more loudly, and annoyed the
Ministry by the violence of its attacks on naval
administration.</p>

<p>As the year passed, and England’s triumph in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_358">358</span>
Europe seemed to overshadow the world, the “Times,”
probably recognizing the uselessness of attacking the
Ministry, showed worse temper toward the United
States. The Americans were rarely mentioned, and
always with language of increasing ill humor. “Despicable
in the cabinet, ridiculous in the field,”<a id="FNanchor_461" href="#Footnote_461" class="fnanchor">461</a> the
Americans disappeared from sight in the splendor of
victory at Vittoria and Leipzig. No wish for peace
was suggested, and if the “Times” expressed the
true feelings of the respectable middle class, as it
was supposed to aim at doing, no wish for peace could
be supposed to exist.</p>

<p>Of the ministerial papers the “Courier” was the
best, and of course was emphatic in support of the
American war. The Ministry were known to be
lukewarm about the United States, and for that reason
they thought themselves obliged to talk in public
as strongly as the strongest against a peace. When
the Russian mediation called for notice, May 13, the
“Courier” at once declared against <span class="locked">it:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Before the war commenced, concession might have
been proper; we always thought it unwise. But the
hour of concession and compromise is passed. America
has rushed unnecessarily and unnaturally into war, and
she must be made to feel the effects of her folly and injustice;
peace must be the consequence of punishment,
and retraction of her insolent demands must precede
negotiation. The thunders of our cannon must first
strike terror into the American shores.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_359">359</span></p>

<p>The “Courier” felt that Americans were not Englishmen,
and could not forgive it, but was unable to
admit that they might still exercise a considerable
influence on human <span class="locked">affairs:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“They have added nothing to literature, nothing to
any of the sciences; they have not produced one good
poet, not one celebrated historian! Their statesmen are
of a mixed breed,—half metaphysicians, half politicians;
all the coldness of the one with all the cunning of the
other. Hence we never see anything enlarged in their
conceptions or grand in their measures.”<a id="FNanchor_462" href="#Footnote_462" class="fnanchor">462</a></p>
</div>

<p>These reasons were hardly sufficient to prove the
right of impressing American seamen. The literary,
metaphysical, or social qualities of Americans, their
“enlarged conceptions,” and the grandeur or littleness
of their measures, had by common consent
ceased to enter into discussion, pending a settlement
of the simpler issue, whether Americans could fight.
For a long time the English press encouraged the
belief that Americans were as incapable of fighting
as of producing poets and historians. Their naval
victories were attributed to British seamen. Perhaps
the first turn of the tide was in November, 1813,
when news of Perry’s victory on Lake Erie crossed
in London the news of Napoleon’s defeat at Leipzig.
Perry’s victory, like those of Hull, Decatur, and Bainbridge,
was too complete for dispute: “It may, however,
serve to diminish our vexation at this occurrence
to learn that the flotilla in question was not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_360">360</span>
any branch of the British navy, ... but a local
force, a kind of mercantile military.”<a id="FNanchor_463" href="#Footnote_463" class="fnanchor">463</a></p>

<p>By a curious coincidence, Castlereagh’s official letter
to Monroe, offering direct negotiation, was dated
the same day, November 4, when news of the victory
at Leipzig met in London news of the defeat
on Lake Erie, and Castlereagh probably meant to
allow no newspaper prejudices to obstruct a peace;
but public opinion was slow to recover its balance.
When news arrived that the Americans had captured
Malden, recovered Detroit, and destroyed Proctor’s
army on the Thames, the “Courier” showed the
first symptom of change in opinion by expressing a
somewhat simple-minded wish to hear no more about
the <span class="locked">Americans:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The intelligence is unpleasant, but we confess that
we do not view, and have never from the beginning of
the war viewed, the events in America with any very
powerful interest. The occurrences in Europe will no
doubt produce a very decisive effect upon the American
government; and unless it is more obstinate and stupid
in its hostility than even <em>we</em> think it, it will do as the
other allies of Bonaparte have done,—abandon him.”</p>
</div>

<p>If the national extravagance could be expected to
show its full force in one direction rather than in
another, naturalized Americans taken in arms were
certain to produce it. The issue was regularly raised
after Van Rensselaer’s defeat at Queenston in 1812.
When the American prisoners arrived at Quebec,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_361">361</span>
they were mustered, and twenty-three native-born
subjects of Great Britain, belonging to the First,
Sixth, and Thirteenth U.&nbsp;S. Infantry, were taken
from the ranks and shipped to England to be put
on trial as British subjects for bearing arms against
their king. The American agent in London reported
to the President that the men had arrived there for
the reason given. Secretary Armstrong, May 15,
1813, then ordered twenty-three British soldiers into
close confinement as hostages. The British government
directed Sir George Prevost to put double the
number of Americans in close confinement, and Sir
George, in giving notice of this measure to General
Wilkinson, October 17, 1813,<a id="FNanchor_464" href="#Footnote_464" class="fnanchor">464</a> <span class="locked">added:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I have been further instructed by his Majesty’s
government to notify to you for the information of the
government of the United States that the commanders of
his Majesty’s armies and fleets on the coasts of America
have received instructions to prosecute the war with unmitigated
severity against all cities, towns, and villages
belonging to the United States, and against the inhabitants
thereof, if, after this communication shall have
been made to you, and a reasonable time given for its
being transmitted to the American government, that government
shall unhappily not be deterred from putting to
death any of the soldiers who now are or who may hereafter
be kept as hostages for the purposes stated in the
letter from Major-General Dearborn.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_362">362</span></p>

<p>The limit of retaliation was soon reached, for the
number of prisoners was small on both sides. The
British government somewhat carefully refrained from
committing itself too far; but the press treated the
matter as though it were vital.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“If Mr. Madison,” said the “Courier” of July 24,
“dare to retaliate by taking away the life of one English
prisoner in revenge for a British subject fully proved to
be such being taken in the act of voluntarily bearing arms
against his country, America puts herself out of the protection
of the law of nations, and must be treated as an
outlaw. An army and navy acting against her will then
be absolved from all obligation to respect the usages and
laws of war. Hostilities may be carried on against her
in any mode until she is brought to a proper sense of
her conduct.”</p>
</div>

<p>The “Morning Post” of December 28 called for
the execution of British subjects taken in arms, and
for retaliation on retaliation in defiance of “the brutal
wretches who, after betraying, are still suffered to
govern America.” The “Times” of May 24 spoke
with hardly less vehemence. Probably such talk was
not shared by the government, for the government
never tested its sincerity by bringing the men to
trial; but at the close of 1813 public opinion in England
was supposed to be tending toward extreme
measures against the United States. The approaching
fall of Napoleon threatened to throw America
outside the pale of civilization. Englishmen seemed
ready to accept the idea that Madison and Napoleon<span class="pagenum" id="Page_363">363</span>
should be coupled together, and that no peace should
be made which did not include the removal of both
from office and power. Of all periods in American
history this was probably the least adapted to negotiation,
but while England was at the moment of her
most extravagant sense of power, President Madison
received and accepted Castlereagh’s offer to negotiate,
and Gallatin went with Bayard to London to hasten
the approach of peace.</p>

<h2 class="nobreak" id="CHAPTER_XV"><span id="toclink_364"></span>CHAPTER XV.</h2>
</div>

<p><span class="smcap">Congress</span> assembled Dec. 6, 1813, at a time of
general perplexity. The victories of Perry and Harrison,
September 10 and October 5, had recovered
Detroit and even conquered a part of West Canada,
but their successes were already dimmed by the failures
of Wilkinson and Hampton before Montreal,
and the retreat of both generals November 13 within
United States territory. In the Creek country the
Georgians had failed to advance from the east, and
Jackson was stopped at Fort Strother by want of
supplies and men. At sea the navy was doing little,
while the British blockade from New London southward
was becoming more and more ruinous to the
Southern and Middle States, and through them to the
government. Abroad the situation was not yet desperate.
The latest news from Europe left Napoleon
at Dresden, victorious for the moment, before the
great battles of October. From the American commissioners
at St. Petersburg no news had arrived,
but England’s refusal to accept mediation was unofficially
known. With this material the President
was obliged to content himself in framing his Annual
Message.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_365">365</span></p>

<p>The Message sent to Congress December 7 began
by expressing regret that the British government had
disappointed the reasonable anticipation of discussing
and, if possible, adjusting the rights and pretensions
in dispute. From France nothing had been received
on the subjects of negotiation. Madison congratulated
Congress on the success of the navy upon the
ocean and the Lakes, and the victory won by Harrison
and R.&nbsp;M. Johnson in Canada. He mentioned briefly
the failure of the armies on the St. Lawrence, and at
greater length the success of Jackson on the Coosa;
and he entered in detail into the retaliatory measures
taken on either side in regard to naturalized soldiers.
The finances were treated with more show of confidence
than was warranted by the prospects of the
Treasury; and the Message closed by a succession
of paragraphs which seemed written in a spirit of
panegyric upon <span class="locked">war:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The war has proved moreover that our free government
like other free governments, though slow in its
early movements, acquires in its progress a force proportioned
to its freedom; and that the Union of these
States, the guardian of the freedom and safety of all and
of each, is strengthened by every occasion that puts it to
the test. In fine, the war with its vicissitudes is illustrating
the capacity and the destiny of the United States
to be a great, a flourishing, and a powerful nation.”</p>
</div>

<p>The rule that feeble and incompetent governments
acquire strength by exercise, and especially in war,
had been as well understood in 1798 as it was in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_366">366</span>
1813, and had been the chief cause of Republican antipathy
to war; but had Madison publicly expressed
the same sentiment in 1798 as in 1813, he would
have found himself in a better position to enforce the
rights for which he was struggling when the extreme
discontent of nearly one third of the States contradicted
his congratulations on “the daily testimony of
increasing harmony throughout the Union.” Whatever
the ultimate result of the war might be, it had
certainly not thus far strengthened the Union. On
the contrary, public opinion seemed to be rapidly
taking the shape that usually preceded a rupture of
friendly relations between political societies. Elections
in the Middle States showed that the war, if not
actually popular, had obliged the people there to support
the government for fear of worse evils. New
Jersey by a small majority returned to its allegiance,
and the city of New York elected a Republican to
represent it in Congress; but the steady drift of opinion
in the Middle States toward the war was simultaneous
with an equally steady drift in the Eastern
States against it.</p>

<p>The evidences of chronic discontent in the Eastern
States were notorious. Less than a month before
Madison wrote his Annual Message, Governor Chittenden
of Vermont, by proclamation November 10,
recalled the State militia from national service:<a id="FNanchor_465" href="#Footnote_465" class="fnanchor">465</a></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He cannot conscientiously discharge the trust reposed
in him by the voice of his fellow-citizens, and by the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_367">367</span>
Constitution of this and the United States, without an
unequivocal declaration that in his opinion the military
strength and resources of this State must be reserved
for its own defence and protection exclusively, excepting
in cases provided for by the Constitution of the United
States, and then under orders derived only from the
commander-in-chief.”</p>
</div>

<p>The intercourse between the Eastern States and the
enemy was notorious. The Federalist press of Massachusetts,
encouraged by Russian and English success
in Europe, discussed the idea of withdrawing the
State from all share in the war, and making a separate
arrangement with England. The President’s
first act, after sending to Congress his Annual Message,
was to send a special Message incidentally calling
attention to the want of harmony that paralyzed
the energy of the government.</p>

<p>The special and secret Message of December 9
asked Congress once more to impose an embargo.
Considering the notorious antipathy of the Eastern
States to the system of embargo, the new experiment
was so hazardous as to require proof of its necessity.
That it was directed against the commerce of the
New England States was evident, for the blockade
answered the purposes of embargo elsewhere. The
Message seemed to propose that all commerce should
cease because any commerce must favor the enemy;
in effect, it urged that New England should be forbidden
to sell or buy so long as the rest of the
country was prevented from doing so.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_368">368</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The tendency of our commercial and navigation laws
in their present state to favor the enemy,” said Madison,<a id="FNanchor_466" href="#Footnote_466" class="fnanchor">466</a>
“and thereby prolong the war, is more and more
developed by experience. Supplies of the most essential
kinds find their way not only to British ports and British
armies at a distance, but the armies in our neighborhood
with which our own are contending derive from our ports
and outlets a subsistence attainable with difficulty if at
all from other sources. Even the fleets and troops infesting
our coasts and waters are by like supplies accommodated
and encouraged in their predatory and incursive
warfare. Abuses having a like tendency take place in
our import trade. British fabrics and products find their
way into our ports under the name and from the ports of
other countries, and often in British vessels disguised as
neutrals by false colors and papers.... To shorten as
much as possible the duration of the war, it is indispensable
that the enemy should feel all the pressure that can
be given to it.”</p>
</div>

<p>Although Madison pointed to the notorious supply
of food for the British forces in Canada as one of the
motives for imposing an embargo, no one supposed
that motive to be decisive. Other laws already forbade
and punished such communication with the
enemy; and experience proved that a general embargo
would be no more effective than any special
prohibition. The idea that England could be distressed
by an embargo seemed still less likely to
influence Government. Congress knew that Russia,
Prussia, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, Spain, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_369">369</span>
South America were already open to English commerce,
and that a few days must decide whether
Napoleon could much longer prevent Great Britain
from trading with France. The possibility of distressing
England by closing Boston and Salem, New
Bedford and Newport to neutral ships was not to
be seriously treated.</p>

<p>Whatever was the true motive of the President’s
recommendation, Congress instantly approved it. The
next day, December 10, the House went into secret
session, and after two days of debate passed an Embargo
Act by a vote of eighty-five to fifty-seven,
which quickly passed the Senate by a vote of twenty
to fourteen, and received the President’s approval
December 17, being the first legislation adopted at
the second session of the Thirteenth Congress.<a id="FNanchor_467" href="#Footnote_467" class="fnanchor">467</a> The
Act was at once enforced with so much severity that
within a month Congress was obliged to consider
and quickly adopted another Act<a id="FNanchor_468" href="#Footnote_468" class="fnanchor">468</a> relieving from its
operation the people of Nantucket, who were in a
state of starvation, all communication with the main
land having been forbidden by the law; but nothing
proved that the illicit communication with Canada
ceased.</p>

<p>This beginning of legislation at a time when the
crisis of the war could be plainly seen approaching
suggested much besides want of harmony. The embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_370">370</span>
strengthened the antipathy of New England to
the war,—a result sufficiently unfortunate; but it also
led to a number of other consequences that were
doubtless foreseen by the Administration, since they
were prophesied by the Federalists. The Act was
approved December 17. Hardly had it gone into
operation when the British schooner “Bramble” arrived
at Annapolis, December 30, bringing a letter
from Castlereagh to Monroe offering to negotiate
directly, though declining mediation. Important as
this news was, it did not compare with that in the
newspapers brought by the “Bramble.” These contained
official reports from Germany of great battles
fought at Leipzig October 16, 18, and 19, in which the
allies had overwhelmed Napoleon in defeat so disastrous
that any hope of his continuing to make head
against them in Germany was at an end. Except
France, the whole continent of Europe already was
open to British commerce, or soon must admit it.
From that moment the New England Federalists no
longer doubted their own power. Their tone rose;
their opposition to the war became more threatening;
their schemes ceased to be negative, and began to
include plans for positive interference; and the embargo
added strength to their hatred of Madison and
the Union.</p>

<p>Madison was seldom quick in changing his views,
but the battle of Leipzig was an event so portentous
that optimism could not face it. Other depressing
news poured in. Fort George was evacuated; Fort<span class="pagenum" id="Page_371">371</span>
Niagara was disgracefully lost; Lewiston, Black Rock,
and Buffalo were burned, and the region about Niagara
was laid waste; blue lights were seen at New
London. Every prospect was dark, but the battle of
Leipzig was fatal to the last glimmer of hope that
England could be brought to reason, or that New
England could be kept quiet. A change of policy
could not safely be delayed.</p>

<p>Castlereagh’s offer was instantly accepted. January
5 Monroe replied, with some complaint at the
refusal of mediation, that the President acceded to
the offer of negotiating at Gothenburg. The next day
Madison sent the correspondence to Congress, with a
warning not to relax “vigorous preparations for carrying
on the war.” A week afterward, January 14,
he nominated J.&nbsp;Q. Adams, J.&nbsp;A. Bayard, Henry Clay,
and Jonathan Russell as commissioners to negotiate
directly with Great Britain, and the Senate confirmed
the nominations, January 18, with little opposition
except to Jonathan Russell’s further nomination as
Minister to Sweden, which was confirmed by the narrow
vote of sixteen to fourteen. Three weeks later,
February 8, Albert Gallatin was added to the commission,
George W. Campbell being nominated to the
Treasury.</p>

<p>The prompt acceptance of Castlereagh’s offer, the
addition of Henry Clay to the negotiators, and the
removal of Gallatin from the Treasury showed that
diplomacy had resumed more than its old importance.
The hope of peace might serve to quiet New England<span class="pagenum" id="Page_372">372</span>
for a time, but mere hope with so little to nourish it
could not long pacify any one, if the embargo was to
remain in force. Several signs indicated there also a
change of policy. Besides the embargo, and in support
of its restrictions, Madison had recommended
the passage of bills prohibiting collusive captures,
ransoming vessels captured by the enemy, and interference
by the courts, as well as the introduction of
British woollens, cottons, and spirits. The bill prohibiting
woollens and other articles was reported to
the Senate December 30, the day when the “Bramble”
reached Annapolis. The Senate waited nearly a
month, till January 27, and then passed the bill, January
31, by a vote of sixteen to twelve. The House
referred it to the Committee on Foreign Relations
February 3, where it remained. On the other hand,
the bill prohibiting ransoms was introduced in the
House December 30, and passed January 26 by a
vote of eighty to fifty-seven. The Senate referred it
January 28 to the Committee on Foreign Relations,
which never reported it. The fate of these measures
foreshadowed the destiny of the embargo.</p>

<p>Yet the President clung to his favorite measure
with a degree of obstinacy that resembled desperation.
Congress showed by its indifference to the two
supplementary bills that it had abandoned the President’s
system as early as January, but the embargo
continued throughout the winter, and the month of
March passed without its removal. The news from
Europe at the close of that month left no doubt that<span class="pagenum" id="Page_373">373</span>
Napoleon could offer little effectual resistance even
in France to the allies, whose armies were known to
have crossed the Rhine, while Wellington advanced
on Bordeaux. Holland was restored to her ancient
independence, and Napoleon was understood to have
accepted in principle, for a proposed Congress at
Mannheim, the old boundaries of France as a basis
of negotiation. In theory, the overthrow of Napoleon
should have not essentially affected the embargo or
the Non-importation Acts, which were expected to
press upon England independently of Napoleon’s Continental
system; but in practice the embargo having
produced no apparent effect on Europe during the
war, could not be expected to produce an effect after
England had succeeded in conquering France, and
had abandoned her blockades as France had abandoned
her decrees. For that reason avowedly Madison
at last yielded, and sent a Message to Congress
March 31, recommending that the system of commercial
restriction should <span class="locked">cease:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Taking into view the mutual interests which the
United States and the foreign nations in amity with her
have in a liberal commercial intercourse, and the extensive
changes favorable thereto which have recently
taken place; taking into view also the important advantages
which may otherwise result from adapting the
state of our commercial laws to the circumstances now
<span class="locked">existing,”—</span></p>
</div>

<p>Taking into view only these influences, Madison
seemed to ignore the supposed chief motive of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_374">374</span>
embargo in stopping supplies for Canada, and to admit
that embargo was an adjunct of Napoleon’s Continental
system; but in truth Madison’s motives, both
political and financial, were deeper and more decisive
than any he alleged. His retreat was absolute. He
recommended that Congress should throw open the
ports, and should abandon all restriction on commerce
beyond a guaranty of war duties for two years after
peace as a measure of protection to American manufactures.
The failure of the restrictive system was
not disguised.</p>

<p>The House received the Message with a mixed
sense of relief and consternation, and referred it to
Calhoun’s committee, which reported April 4 a bill
for repealing the Embargo and Non-importation Acts,
together with the reasons which led the committee to
unite with the Executive in abandoning the restrictive
system.</p>

<p>Calhoun had always opposed the commercial policy
of Jefferson and Madison. For him the sudden Executive
change was a conspicuous triumph; but he
showed remarkable caution in dealing with the House.
Instead of attempting to coerce the majority, according
to his habit, by the force of abstract principles,
he adopted Madison’s reasoning and softened his
own tone, seeming disposed to coax his Southern
and Western friends from making a display of useless
ill-temper. “Men cannot go straight forward,” he
said, “but must regard the obstacles which impede
their course. Inconsistency consists in a change of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_375">375</span>
conduct when there is no change of circumstances
which justify it.” The changes in the world’s circumstances
required a return to free trade; but the
manufactures would not be left unprotected,—on the
contrary, “he hoped at all times and under every
policy they would be protected with due care.”<a id="FNanchor_469" href="#Footnote_469" class="fnanchor">469</a></p>

<p>As an example of political inconsistency, as Calhoun
defined it, his pledge to protect American manufactures
deserved to be remembered; but hardly had
Calhoun’s words died on the echoes of the House
when another distinguished statesman offered a prospective
example even more striking of what Calhoun
excused. Daniel Webster rose, and in the measured
and sonorous tones which impressed above all the
idea of steadfastness in character, he pronounced a
funeral oration over the restrictive <span class="locked">system:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“It was originally offered to the people of this country
as a kind of political faith; it was to be believed,
not examined; ... it was to be our political salvation,
nobody knew exactly how; and any departure from it
would lead to political ruin, nobody could tell exactly
why.”</p>
</div>

<p>Its opponents had uniformly contended that it was
auxiliary to Napoleon’s Continental system, in co-operation
with Napoleon’s government; and its abandonment
with the fall of Napoleon showed the truth.
While thus exulting in the overthrow of the first
“American system,” Webster qualified his triumph
by adding that he was, “generally speaking,” not the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_376">376</span>
enemy of manufactures; he disliked only the rearing
them in <span class="locked">hot-beds:—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I am not in haste to see Sheffields and Birminghams
in America.... I am not anxious to accelerate the approach
of the period when the great mass of American
labor shall not find its employment in the field; when the
young men of the country shall be obliged to shut their
eyes upon external Nature,—upon the heavens and the
earth,—and immerse themselves in close and unwholesome
workshops; when they shall be obliged to shut their
ears to the bleatings of their own flocks upon their own
hills, and to the voice of the lark that cheers them at the
plough, that they may open them in dust and smoke and
steam, to the perpetual whirl of spools and spindles and
the grating of rasps and saws.”</p>
</div>

<p>Potter of Rhode Island, where the new manufactures
centred, spoke hotly against the change. Much
Federalist capital had been drawn into the manufacturing
business as well as into speculation in all
articles of necessity which the blockade and the embargo
made scarce. At heart the Federalists were
not unanimous in wishing for a repeal of the restrictive
system, and Potter represented a considerable
class whose interests were involved in maintaining
high prices. He admitted that the average duties
would still give American manufactures an advantage
of thirty-six per cent, without including freight and
marine risks, but he insisted that the bill was intended
to encourage importations of British goods
“that we do not want and can do very well without,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_377">377</span>
in order to raise a revenue from the people in an
indirect way.”</p>

<p>Probably Potter’s explanation of the change in
system was correct. The necessities of the Treasury
were doubtless a decisive cause of Madison’s step;
but these necessities were foreseen by the Federalists
when Madison recommended the embargo, and the
neglect to give them due weight exposed the Administration
to grave reproach. “A government which
cannot administer the affairs of a nation,” said Webster,
“without producing so frequent and such violent
alterations in the ordinary occupations and pursuits
of private life, has in my opinion little claim to the
regard of the community.”</p>

<p>The Republicans made no attempt to defend themselves
from such criticisms. Among the small number
who refused to follow Calhoun was Macon, who
sat in his seat during the debate writing to his
friend Judge Nicholson.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Those who voted the embargo so very lately,” he
said,<a id="FNanchor_470" href="#Footnote_470" class="fnanchor">470</a> “and those or him who recommended it must, I
think, feel a little sore under Webster’s rubs.... I have
not for a long time seen the Feds look in so good humor.
They have all a smile on their countenances, and look at
each other as if they were the men which had brought
this great and good work about.... The Republicans
have not the most pleasing countenances. Those who
support the bill do not look gay or very much delighted
with their majority, and those who expect to be in the
minority have a melancholy gloom over their faces.”</p>
</div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_378">378</span></p>

<p>That the system of commercial restrictions had
failed was admitted, but the failure carried no conviction
of error to its friends. Physical force had also
apparently failed. The Southern Republicans had no
choice but to adopt strong measures, giving to the
government powers which in their opinion they had
no constitutional right to confer; but they remained
unshaken in their opinions.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I confess to you,” wrote Macon, “that the parties
seem by their acts to be approaching each other, and I
fear that tough times is a strong argument with many
of us to stretch the Constitution; and the difference between
expediency and constitutionality becomes every
day less. Notwithstanding this, I do not despair of
the republic, because my dependence has always been
on the people; and their influence was felt in laying
the embargo, and probably that of the Executive in
repealing it.”</p>
</div>

<p>No one understood or represented so well as Macon
the instincts and ideas of the Southern people at that
time, and he never represented them more truly than
in the matter of the embargo. Virginia and the
Carolinas were with him at heart. Macon’s hopes
for the republic depended on his confidence in the
people; and that confidence in its turn depended on
his belief that the people were still true to a dogma
which the Government had abandoned as impracticable.
The belief was well founded, as the course of
events proved. The House, April 7, by a vote of one
hundred and fifteen to thirty-seven, passed the bill repealing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_379">379</span>
the Embargo and Non-importation Acts; the
Senate also passed it, April 12, by a vote of twenty-six
to four; the President, April 14, approved it; and
from that day the restrictive system, which had been
the cardinal point of Jefferson’s and Madison’s statesmanship,
seemed to vanish from the public mind and
the party politics of the country. Yet so deeply riveted
was the idea of its efficacy among the Southern people,
that at the next great crisis of their history they
staked their lives and fortunes on the same belief of
their necessity to Europe which had led them into
the experiment of coercing Napoleon and Canning
by commercial deprivations; and their second experiment
had results still more striking than those which
attended their first.</p>

<p>The explanation of this curious popular trait certainly
lay in the nature of Southern society; but
the experience was common to the whole Union.
When the restrictive system was abandoned of necessity
in April, 1814, it had brought the country
to the verge of dissolution. The Government could
neither make war nor peace; the public seemed
indifferent or hostile; and the same traits which
characterized the restrictive system continued to
paralyze the efforts of Congress to adopt more energetic
methods.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“I will yet hope we may have no more war,” wrote
Mrs. Madison to Mrs. Gallatin Jan. 7, 1814.<a id="FNanchor_471" href="#Footnote_471" class="fnanchor">471</a> “If we
do, alas! alas! we are not making ready as we ought<span class="pagenum" id="Page_380">380</span>
to do. Congress trifle away the most precious of their
days,—days that ought to be devoted to the defence
of their divided country.”</p>
</div>

<p>Mrs. Madison doubtless echoed the language she
heard used at the White House; yet the leaders of
Congress were neither triflers nor idlers, and they
did all that public opinion permitted. Within a week
after Mrs. Madison’s complaint, the military committee
of the House reported a bill for encouraging enlistments.
Viewed as a means of embodying the
whole military strength of the republic to resist
the whole military strength of Great Britain, about
to be released from service in Europe, Troup’s
bill<a id="FNanchor_472" href="#Footnote_472" class="fnanchor">472</a> was not an efficient measure; but it terrified
Congress.</p>

<p>During the campaign of 1813, as the story has
shown, the Government never succeeded in placing
more than ten or eleven thousand effective rank-and-file
in the field in a single body. About as many
more were in garrison, and the sick-list was always
large. Armstrong reported to the Ways and Means
Committee that the aggregate strength of the army
in February, 1813, was 18,945; in June, 27,609; in
December, 34,325; and Jan. 17, 1814, it was 33,822.<a id="FNanchor_473" href="#Footnote_473" class="fnanchor">473</a>
Discouraging as this report was, it concealed the
worst part of the situation. In truth, the abstract
furnished by the adjutant-general’s office gave the
number of regular troops in service for January, 1814,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_381">381</span>
not as 33,822, but as 23,614; and to the return a
note was appended, explaining that “although the
numerical force in January, 1814, was 23,614, the actual
strength of the army at that time was less than
half that number, arising from the expiration of the
term of service of the troops raised in 1809 and enlisted
for five years, and of the twelve and eighteen-months
men enlisted in 1812–1813.”<a id="FNanchor_474" href="#Footnote_474" class="fnanchor">474</a> The establishment
consisted of 58,254 men authorized by law;
but the legal establishment was not half filled. The
European news showed that England would soon be
able to reinforce her army in Canada and take the
offensive. Instead of sixty thousand men, Armstrong
needed twice that number for a moderately safe defence,
since every part of the sea-coast stood at the
enemy’s mercy, and no adequate defence was possible
which did not include an offensive return somewhere
on the Canadian frontier. Needing more than
one hundred thousand,—authorized by law to enlist
sixty thousand,—he could depend on less than thirty
thousand men. Yet so far from attempting to increase
the establishment, Armstrong hoped only to
fill the ranks.</p>

<p>Troup’s bill aimed at that object, purporting to be
“A Bill making further provision for filling of the
ranks of the regular army.” No system of draft
was suggested. Troup’s committee proposed to treble
the bounty rather than raise the pay,—a system<span class="pagenum" id="Page_382">382</span>
which might be economical in a long war; but if
the war should last only one year, the soldier must
gain four fifths of his bounty without return. Troup
first suggested one hundred dollars as bounty, which
Congress raised to one hundred and twenty-four dollars,
together with three hundred and twenty acres
of land as already fixed. The pay of privates remained
at ten dollars. Twenty-four dollars of the
bounty was to be paid only on the soldier’s discharge.
Recruiting-agents were to receive eight dollars for
each recruit.</p>

<p>Such a provision for filling the ranks could not be
called excessive. Even if the whole bounty were
added to the pay, and the soldier were to serve but
twelve months, he would receive only twenty dollars
a month and his land-certificate. If he served his
whole term of five years, he received little more than
twelve dollars a month. The inducement was not
great in such a community as the United States.
The chance that such a measure would fill the ranks
was small; yet the measure seemed extravagant to
a party that had formerly pledged itself against mercenary
armies.</p>

<p>If the bill showed the timidity of the Republicans,
it called out worse qualities in the Federalists. The
speeches of the opposition were for the most part
general in their criticisms and denunciations, and deserved
little attention; but that of Daniel Webster
was doubly interesting, because Webster was not only
the ablest but among the most cautious of his party.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_383">383</span>
His speech<a id="FNanchor_475" href="#Footnote_475" class="fnanchor">475</a> suggested much of the famous eloquence
of his later oratory, but dwelt on ideas to which his
later life was opposed, and followed lines of argument
surprising in a statesman of his great intellectual
powers. His chief theme was the duty of government
to wage only a defensive war, except on the
ocean. “Give up your futile projects of invasion.
Extinguish the fires that blaze on your inland frontiers.”
He wished the government to use its forces
only to repel invasion.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“The enemy, as we have seen, can make no permanent
stand in any populous part of the country. Its citizens
will drive back his forces to the line; but at that line
where defence ceases and invasion begins, they stop.
They do not pass it because they do not choose to pass
it. Offering no serious obstacle to their actual power, it
rises like a Chinese wall against their sentiments and
their feelings.”</p>
</div>

<p>This advice, which echoed a Federalist idea reasonable
or excusable in 1812, was out of place in
January, 1814. The battles of Leipzig and Vittoria
had settled the question of offensive and defensive in
Canada. The offensive had passed into British hands,
and a successful defence was all that the United
States could hope. The interests of New England as
well as of New York and of the whole Union required
that the defensive campaign should, if possible, be
fought on Canadian soil rather than at Plattsburg,
Washington, or New Orleans; and even the most extreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_384">384</span>
Federalist could scarcely be believed blind to
an idea so obvious.</p>

<p>Moderate as the bill was, fifty-eight members voted
against it, while ninety-seven voted in its favor. In
the Senate the bill passed without a division, and received,
January 27, the President’s approval. Meanwhile
the Senate passed bills for converting the
twelve-months regiments into regiments enlisted for
the war, as well as for raising three rifle regiments
for the same term, and any number of volunteers that
in the President’s opinion the public service required,
offering to all recruits for these corps the same inducements
as to the regular regiments. These bills
produced another and a longer debate, but were
passed without serious opposition. No further addition
was made to the regular army, and no other
effort to obtain recruits.</p>

<p>Thus organized, the army consisted of forty-six
regiments of infantry enlisted for five years,—four
rifle regiments; an artillery corps and a regiment of
light artillery; a regiment of dragoons; the engineer
corps, the rangers, and sea-fencibles,—an aggregate
of 62,773 men authorized by law, an increase of only
five thousand men over that of the previous year.</p>

<p>The appropriations for the military establishment
amounted to nearly twenty-five million dollars, the
Federalists alone voting against them. The naval
appropriations amounted to seven millions, and were
voted without opposition. The Secretary of the Navy
discouraged the building of more cruisers, owing to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_385">385</span>
want of timber and seamen; but Congress showed
more than ordinary sagacity by appropriating half a
million dollars for the construction of floating batteries
with steam-power.</p>

<p>Such provision for the coming campaign offered
little evidence of increasing energy to make head
against the vastly increased military and naval power
of England; but the financial outlook was much
worse than the military, and Congress dared not face
it. The acting Secretary of the Treasury, William
Jones, sent his annual report to the House January
8, and so far as his balance-sheet went, no difficulties
were apparent. He had disbursed thirty million dollars
during the past fiscal year, and needed nearly
forty millions for the current year. These sums were
not excessive when compared with the wealth of the
country or its exertions at other periods of national
danger. Half a century afterward the people of the
Southern States, not much more numerous than the
people of the Union in 1812, and with a far larger
proportion of slaves, supported during four years the
burden of an army numbering nearly five hundred
thousand men. For the same period the Northern
people, not much exceeding twenty millions in number,
lent their government more than five hundred
million dollars a year. The efforts of 1864, proportioned
to the population, were nearly ten times as
great as those of 1814, when Secretary Jones looked
with well-founded alarm at the prospect of borrowing
thirty millions for the year, and of maintaining<span class="pagenum" id="Page_386">386</span>
an army which could scarcely be expected to number
forty thousand rank-and-file.</p>

<p>The United States, with a proper currency and
untouched resources, should have found no serious
difficulty in borrowing thirty or even fifty millions a
year in 1814; but they were in reality on the verge
of bankruptcy, although the national resources were
probably ample. The amount of private capital available
for loans was uncertain, and the amount of
circulating medium was equally doubtful. Timothy
Pitkin of Connecticut, perhaps the best authority in
Congress, thought that the paid bank capital of the
United States did not much exceed sixty millions,<a id="FNanchor_476" href="#Footnote_476" class="fnanchor">476</a>
and that the notes of these banks in circulation did
not reach thirty millions. His estimate of paid bank
capital was probably liberal, but his estimate of the
circulation was eight or ten millions too small. Had
the Treasury been able to count on the use of these
resources, they might have answered all necessary
purposes; but between the mistakes of the government
and the divisions of the people, the Treasury
was left with no sound resources whatever.</p>

<p>The first and fatal blow to the Treasury was the
loss of the Bank of the United States, which left the
government without financial machinery or a sound
bank-note circulation. The next blow, almost equally
severe, was the loss of the Massachusetts and Connecticut
banks, which were the strongest in the Union.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_387">387</span>
Whether the responsibility for the loss rested on the
Executive, Congress, or the two States might be a
subject for dispute; but whoever was responsible, the
effect was ruinous. The New England banks were
financial agents of the enemy. The bank capital of
Massachusetts including Maine was about twelve and a
quarter million dollars; that of Connecticut exceeded
three millions. The whole bank capital of New England
reached eighteen millions,<a id="FNanchor_477" href="#Footnote_477" class="fnanchor">477</a> or nearly one third
of the paid bank capital of the whole country, if
Pitkin’s estimate was correct. That nearly one third
of the national resources should be withdrawn from
the aid of government was serious enough; but in
reality the loss was much greater, for New England
held a still larger proportion of the specie on which
the bank circulation of other States depended.</p>

<p>The system of commercial restrictions was responsible
for thus, at the most critical moment of the war,
throwing the control of the national finances into the
hands of the Boston Federalists. Against the protests
of the Federalists, manufactures had been forced
upon them by national legislation until New England
supplied the Union with articles of necessary use at
prices practically fixed by her own manufacturers.
From the whole country specie began to flow toward
Boston as early as the year 1810, and with astonishing
rapidity after the war was declared. The British
blockade stimulated the movement, and the embargo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_388">388</span>
of December, 1813, which lasted till April, 1814, cut
off every other resource from the Southern and Western
States. Unable longer to send their crops even
to New England for a market, they were obliged to
send specie, and they soon came to the end of their
supply. The Massachusetts banks, which reported
about $820,000 in specie in 1809, returned more than
$3,680,000 in June, 1812; which rose to $5,780,000
in June, 1813, and reached nearly $7,000,000 in June,
1814. In five years the Massachusetts banks alone
drew more than six million dollars in specie from the
Southern and Middle States,<a id="FNanchor_478" href="#Footnote_478" class="fnanchor">478</a> besides what they sent
to Canada in payment for British bills.</p>

<p>No one knew how much specie the country contained.
Gallatin afterward estimated it at seventeen
million dollars,<a id="FNanchor_479" href="#Footnote_479" class="fnanchor">479</a> and of that amount the banks of New
England in 1814 probably held nearly ten millions.
The Massachusetts banks, with seven millions in
specie, had a bank-note circulation of less than three
millions. The Middle, Southern, and Western States
must have had a bank-note circulation approaching
forty millions in paper, with seven or eight millions in
specie to support it,<a id="FNanchor_480" href="#Footnote_480" class="fnanchor">480</a> while the paper was constantly
increasing in quantity and the specie constantly diminishing.
Bank paper, as was believed, could not
with safety exceed the proportion of three paper dollars<span class="pagenum" id="Page_389">389</span>
to every specie dollar in the bank vaults; but
the banks in 1814 beyond New England were circulating
at least four paper dollars to every silver or
gold dollar, and in many cases were issuing paper
without specie in their possession.</p>

<p>Already the banks of New England were pressing
their demands on those of New York, which in their
turn called on Philadelphia and Baltimore. The
specie drained to New England could find its way
back only by means of government loans, which New
England refused to make in any large amount. On
the other hand, Boston bought freely British Treasury
notes at liberal discount, and sent coin to Canada in
payment of them.<a id="FNanchor_481" href="#Footnote_481" class="fnanchor">481</a> Probably New England lent to
the British government during the war more money
than she lent to her own. The total amount subscribed
in New England to the United States loans
was less than three millions.</p>

<p>This situation was well understood by Congress.
In the debate of February, 1814, the approaching
dangers were repeatedly pointed out. The alarm was
then so great that the Committee of Ways and Means
reported a bill to incorporate a new national bank
with a capital of thirty million dollars, while Macon
openly advocated the issue of government paper,<a id="FNanchor_482" href="#Footnote_482" class="fnanchor">482</a> declaring
that “paper money never was beat.” Congress
after a diffuse debate passed only a loan bill
for twenty-five millions, and an Act for the issue of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_390">390</span>
five million interest-bearing Treasury notes, leaving
with the President the option to issue five millions
more in case he could not borrow it. The legislation
was evidently insufficient, and satisfied no one.
“You have authorized a loan for twenty-five millions,”
said Grundy in the debate of April 2, “and
have provided for the expenditure of so much money.
Where is the money?”</p>

<p>Without attempting to answer this question, April
18 Congress adjourned.</p>

</div>

<p><span class="smcap">While</span> Congress was thus employed, much occurred
behind the scenes that bore directly on the
movements of war. The French minister, Serurier,
alone made official reports, and his letters became
less interesting as his importance diminished; but
occasionally he still threw a ray of light on Madison’s
troubles. At midsummer in 1813 he was in
high spirits.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Within the past week,” Serurier wrote, July 21,
1813,<a id="FNanchor_483" href="#Footnote_483" class="fnanchor">483</a> “we have received, one after another, news of
the fresh successes at the beginning of the campaign,—the
battle of Lützen, the offer of armistice, and the battle
of Bautzen. These events, so glorious for France, have
been so many thunder-strokes for the enemy in America.
Their consternation is equal to their previous confidence,
which had no bounds. The Republicans of Congress, on
the other hand, have received these news in triumph. All
have come to congratulate me, and have told me that they,
not less than we, had been victorious at Lützen. The ascendency,
henceforward irresistible, which his Majesty is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_392">392</span>
acquiring over his enemies, will, I hope, supply a little
tone and vigor to this Government, which had need of
them.”</p>
</div>

<p>When the President returned to Washington, Oct.
25, 1813, Serurier reported with less enthusiasm, but
still with confidence, that Madison remained firm:</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“He expressed himself in very proper, though very
measured, terms on the monstrous coalition that has been
renewed against his Majesty. I remarked to him that
among our advantages we must doubtless count the fact
that the coalition had ten heads, while France had but
one. ‘And what a powerful head!’ replied the President,
instantly, with less grace than conviction in his
whole countenance.”</p>
</div>

<p>The vigor of Napoleon postponed for a few months
the total downfall of Serurier’s influence, but it slowly
waned, and he became more and more grateful for
consideration shown him. The President’s Annual
Message, December 7, met his approval. “All agree
that nothing more energetic or more warlike has
yet come from Mr. Madison’s Cabinet.”<a id="FNanchor_484" href="#Footnote_484" class="fnanchor">484</a> The secret
Message of December 9 and the embargo pleased
him more.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Mr. Monroe assured me three days ago,” continued
Serurier, writing December 10, “that the Government
had been informed of supplies to the extent of nearly
thirty thousand barrels of flour furnished to Canada from
ports of the United States. A rigorous embargo can<span class="pagenum" id="Page_393">393</span>
alone prevent such criminal speculations, and give the
war a decisive character which will shorten its duration
and assure its success.... In this affair is seen a new
proof of Mr. Madison’s obstinacy (<i lang="fr">roideur</i>) which prevents
him from abandoning a measure he has once put
forward, and judges to be for the public interest.”</p>
</div>

<p>The arrival of the “Bramble” with news of the
battle of Leipzig, and with Castlereagh’s offer to negotiate,
left Serurier helpless. “In this state of things,”
he wrote,<a id="FNanchor_485" href="#Footnote_485" class="fnanchor">485</a> January 14, “it would have been difficult
for the Executive to refuse to negotiate; and I cannot
but think that he accedes to it only with regret and
without illusions.” In deference to Serurier’s opinion,
the President appointed Henry Clay as commissioner
to treat for peace rather than Crawford, then American
envoy to Napoleon; but in the last week of March
news arrived from Bordeaux to February 10, announcing
that the allies had reached Troyes and were
advancing on Paris, while Napoleon had accepted
their conditions of negotiation.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“For the moment the public believed everything to be
lost,” reported Serurier, April 15.<a id="FNanchor_486" href="#Footnote_486" class="fnanchor">486</a> “I ought in justice
to say that the President and his Cabinet showed more
coolness and did not share the universal alarm, and that
they continued to show me great confidence in the Emperor’s
genius. I did not find them excessively disturbed
by the march of the allies, or doubtful of our power to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_394">394</span>
repulse them; but I know that his Majesty’s adhesion
to the preliminary conditions of the allies, and yet more
the Congress of Chatillon, and the irresistible influence
necessarily acquired for the British minister, greatly
(<i lang="fr">vivement</i>) alarmed Mr. Madison. He thought he saw,
in the announcement of our adoption of those conditions,
our renunciation of every kind of power and control
over Spain and Germany, where England was to rule.
He believed that a peace, dictated by Lord Castlereagh,
must already have been signed, and that the United
States were to remain alone on the field of battle. It
was then that Mr. Madison, abruptly and without having
in any way prepared the public for it, addressed
to Congress the Message recommending an immediate
repeal of the embargo and a partial repeal of the non-importation.”</p>
</div>

<p>While Serurier explained the suddenness of
Madison’s action by the need of conciliating the
Continental powers and the manufacturing cities of
England, he added that domestic difficulties had a
large share in the decision. Contraband trade had
become general in the Eastern States. A sort of
civil war, he said, was beginning between the officers
of customs and the smugglers; the Government
also felt serious anxiety for the success of its
loan, and began to doubt its ability to maintain payments
for the army and navy. Revenue had become
necessary. Such was the terror caused by the French
news that the capitalists who had offered to contract
for the loan began to withdraw their offers and to say
that it was no longer practicable. “Analyze it as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_395">395</span>
you please,” said Serurier, “you will still find that it
was the passage of the Rhine and the progress of
the allies in France which, in spite of all I could
say, decided this retrograde movement of a Government
which I have hitherto always found firm, wise,
and consequent. But fear does not reason.”</p>

<p>Serurier failed even to obtain permission for French
letters-of-marque to be received with their prizes in
American ports. The President recommended it to
Congress, but Monroe told Serurier that the committee
of Congress had not dared to make a report, being
persuaded that it would be rejected.<a id="FNanchor_487" href="#Footnote_487" class="fnanchor">487</a> “Mr. Monroe
agreed to all I said; granted that Congress was in
the wrong, and I entirely in the right; but nevertheless
Congress has adjourned without considering the
question.” Serurier was disposed to advise the withdrawal
by France of the liberties granted to American
privateers,—a measure which, he might almost
have foreseen, was likely in any case soon to be
taken.</p>

<p>With the repeal of the embargo ended the early
period of United States history, when diplomatists
played a part at Washington equal in importance to
that of the Legislature or the Executive. The statecraft
of Jefferson and Madison was never renewed.
Thenceforward the government ceased to balance between
great foreign Powers, and depended on its own
resources. As far as diplomacy had still a part to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_396">396</span>
play in the year 1814, its field of action was in Europe;
and there the ablest men in civil life were sent.
Gallatin, Bayard, J.&nbsp;Q. Adams, and Crawford were
already on the spot; and Henry Clay, after, resigning
the Speaker’s chair, Jan. 19, 1814, sailed for Gothenburg
to take part in the negotiation.</p>

<p>President Madison sought in vain for men of equal
ability to supply the gaps made by transferring so
many of his strongest supporters to Europe. The
House of Representatives, January 19, elected Langdon
Cheves Speaker; but the choice was a defeat for
Madison, whose friends supported Felix Grundy. The
Federalists, joining those Republicans who were hostile
to commercial restrictions, numbered ninety-four
against fifty-nine votes for Grundy,—and the success
of Cheves foreshadowed the overthrow of the embargo.
In providing for other vacancies the President fared
worse. Cheves was a man of ability, and in general
policy was a friend of the Administration; but most
of the other material upon which the President must
depend was greatly inferior to Cheves. The Cabinet
needed partial reconstruction, and Madison was at a
loss for choice.</p>

<p>The President’s favorite candidate for the Treasury,
after Gallatin showed his determination to remain
abroad, was Alexander James Dallas of Pennsylvania.
Dallas was one of Gallatin’s strongest personal
friends, an old Republican, and a lawyer of
undoubted ability. Born in Jamaica in 1759, like
Gallatin and Hamilton he had become a citizen of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_397">397</span>
the United States before the Constitution or the confederation
was adopted. He had been a leader of
the Republican party in Federalist times, and was
made district-attorney of Pennsylvania by Jefferson;
but Duane and the “Aurora” destroyed his influence
and left him isolated. In Pennsylvania Dallas commanded
no support. Both the senators, Leib and
Lacock, opposed his appointment to the Treasury,
and were able to procure his rejection had Madison
ventured to make it.<a id="FNanchor_488" href="#Footnote_488" class="fnanchor">488</a></p>

<p>Obliged to abandon Dallas, the President offered the
appointment to Richard Rush, the comptroller, who
declined it. At last Madison pitched upon G.&nbsp;W.
Campbell, of Tennessee. Since Crawford’s departure
Campbell had represented the Administration in the
Senate, but neither as senator nor as representative
had he won great distinction. Best known for his duel
with Barent Gardenier, his physical courage was more
apparent than his financial fitness. Campbell brought
no strength to the Administration, and rather weakened
its character among capitalists; but Madison
could think of no one better qualified for the place.
The Republicans were at a loss for leaders. “I do
not complain that Campbell is unfit,” wrote Macon
to Nicholson;<a id="FNanchor_489" href="#Footnote_489" class="fnanchor">489</a> “indeed, if the choice of secretary
must be made out of Congress, I do not know that
a better could be made.” Yet the selection was
unfortunate.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_398">398</span></p>

<p>Madison was also obliged to select a new attorney-general
in place of William Pinkney. Till then the
attorney-general had not been regarded as standing
on the same footing with other members of the Cabinet.
The Secretaries of State and Treasury were paid
five thousand dollars a year; those of the War and
Navy were paid forty-five hundred; but the attorney-general
was paid only three thousand. He had neither
office-room nor clerks, and was not required to reside
permanently at Washington, but pursued the private
business of his profession where he liked, attending
to the business of government rather as a counsel
under general retainer than as a head of Department.
Pinkney lived in Baltimore, and his abilities
were so valuable that the President was glad to employ
them on any terms, and was not inclined to
impose conditions of residence which Pinkney could
not accept without a greater sacrifice than he was
ready to make.<a id="FNanchor_490" href="#Footnote_490" class="fnanchor">490</a> Congress was not so forbearing as
the President. John W. Taylor, a member from New
York, moved a resolution January 5, directing the
Judiciary Committee to inquire into the expediency
of requiring the attorney-general to reside in Washington
during the session of Congress. The committee
reported a bill, January 22, requiring permanent
residence from the attorney-general, with an increase
of salary. The bill failed to become law, but Pinkney
at once resigned.</p>

<p>Madison offered the post to Richard Rush, who<span class="pagenum" id="Page_399">399</span>
accepted it. Rush’s abilities were more than respectable,
and caused regret that he had not accepted
the Treasury, for which he was better fitted than
Campbell; but these changes did not improve the
Cabinet. “His predecessor, Pinkney, I believe considered
him the best lawyer in the nation,” wrote
Macon;<a id="FNanchor_491" href="#Footnote_491" class="fnanchor">491</a> “but that Campbell and Rush are equal to
Gallatin and Pinkney is not, I imagine, believed by
any one who knows them.” In the case of Pinkney
and Rush, the advantages of permanent residence
balanced in part the loss of ability; but no such
consideration affected the change of Campbell for
Gallatin.</p>

<p>Fortunately Madison lost enemies as well as friends.
Time worked steadily in his favor. The old Smith
faction, the Clinton party, and the “Aurora” were
already broken. Senators who claimed too much
independence of action found public opinion setting
strongly against them. Samuel Smith and Giles
were near the end of their terms, and had no chance
of re-election. The legislature of North Carolina,
in December, 1813, censured so severely the conduct
of Senator Stone that the senator resigned his seat.<a id="FNanchor_492" href="#Footnote_492" class="fnanchor">492</a>
At the same time, Pennsylvania succeeded in ridding
herself of Senator Leib, and Madison was able
to punish the postmaster-general, Gideon Granger,
whose friendship for Leib made him obnoxious to
his party.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_400">400</span></p>

<p>Granger was not a member of the Cabinet, but his
patronage was the more important because at that
time, by some anomaly in the law, it was not subject
to approval by the Senate. Early in January one of
his best post-offices, that of Philadelphia, became vacant.
One senator of the United States had already
resigned his seat to become postmaster of New York;
and the Pennsylvanians had reason to fear that Leib,
whose term was about to expire, would resign to become
postmaster of Philadelphia, and that Granger
wished to gratify him. Immediately all the Administration
Republicans, including members of Congress
and of the State legislature, joined in recommending
another man, and warned Granger in private that
his own removal from office would follow the appointment
of Leib.<a id="FNanchor_493" href="#Footnote_493" class="fnanchor">493</a> C.&nbsp;J. Ingersoll—a young member
from Pennsylvania, among the warmest supporters of
Madison and the war—reinforced the threat by moving
the House, January 7, for a committee to amend
the laws with a view to making postmasters subject
to the usual rule of confirmation. The committee
was appointed.</p>

<p>Irritated by this treatment, Granger in defiance of
President and party appointed Michael Leib to the
office, and Leib instantly resigned his seat and hastened
to assume the duties of his new post. In this
transaction Madison was the chief gainer. Not only
did he rid himself of Leib, but he gained a warm<span class="pagenum" id="Page_401">401</span>
ally in the person of Leib’s successor; for the Pennsylvania
legislature, February 28, transferred Jonathan
Roberts from the House to take Leib’s place in
the Senate. Madison’s advantage was not limited by
Leib’s departure or Roberts’s accession. He was able
also to punish Granger in a manner at that time almost
or quite without parallel. Executive offices ran,
as a rule, during good behavior; and although Jefferson
made removals of party enemies, neither he nor
Madison had ventured to remove party friends, except
in cases of misbehavior. Granger’s conduct exasperated
the Pennsylvanians to a point where no rules
were regarded. Eighty-six members of the Pennsylvania
legislature joined in addressing a memorial to
the President demanding the removal of Granger as
the only means of getting rid of Leib, who had not
only opposed Madison’s election, but who, “when entrusted
with one of the highest offices in the gift of
the State, ... acted in direct hostility to her wishes
and interests, and aided as far as possible her political
enemies.” Madison needed little urging. February
25 he nominated to the Senate as postmaster-general
the governor of Ohio, Return Jonathan Meigs. After
some little delay, the Senate confirmed the appointment,
March 17, without a division.</p>

<p>Scarcely was this matter settled, when Congress
yielded to Madison’s opinion in another instance
where for ten years the House had obstinately resisted
his wishes. The Yazoo bill became law. For
this concession several reasons combined. The Supreme<span class="pagenum" id="Page_402">402</span>
Court, through Chief-Justice Marshall, by an
elaborate decision in February, 1810, settled the law
in favor of the claimants. John Randolph’s defeat
removed from Congress the chief obstacle to the proposed
agreement. The threatening attitude of New
England made every palliative necessary. Under
these inducements, the Senate passed the bill, February
28, by a vote of twenty-four to eight, and the
House passed it, March 26, by a vote of eighty-four to
seventy-six.</p>

<p>Little by little the pressure of necessity compelled
Congress and the country to follow Madison’s lead.
Whether for good or for evil, he had his way. His
enemies were overcome and driven from the field;
his friends were rewarded, and his advice followed.
Of revolt within the party he stood no longer in fear.
Already political intrigue and factiousness began to
take a direction which concerned him only so far
as he felt an interest in the choice of his successor.
Three years more would complete Madison’s public
career, and in all probability if another President of
the United States were ever elected, he would be one
of Madison’s friends; but many persons doubted
whether the country would reach another Presidential
election, and the jealousy which actuated New
England against the South was not the only ground
for that opinion. In Madison’s immediate circle of
friends, the jealousy between Virginia and New York
threatened to tear the government in pieces. These
States did not, like Massachusetts, threaten to leave<span class="pagenum" id="Page_403">403</span>
the Union, but their struggles for power promised to
bring government to a standstill.</p>

<p>The antipathy of New York for Virginia was not
lessened by the success of Virginia in overthrowing
Aaron Burr and DeWitt Clinton. The Republican
party in New York quickly produced two new aspirants
to the Presidency, whose hopes were founded on
public weariness of Virginian supremacy. One of the
two candidates was Governor Daniel D. Tompkins,
whose services as war-governor of New York were
great, and were rewarded by great popularity. Governor
Tompkins was too remote from the capital to
annoy Madison by direct contact with factions or
activity in intrigue; but the other rival stood at the
centre of Executive patronage. John Armstrong was
a man capable of using power for personal objects,
and not easily to be prevented from using it as he
pleased.</p>

<p>Armstrong was an unusual character. The local
influences which shaped Americans were illustrated
by the leaders whom New York produced, and by
none better than by Armstrong. Virginians could
not understand, and could still less trust, such a
combination of keenness and will, with absence of
conventional morals as the Secretary of War displayed.
The Virginians were simple in everything;
even their casuistry was old-fashioned. Armstrong’s
mind belonged to modern New York. The Virginians
were a knot of country gentlemen, inspired by
faith in rural virtues, and sustained by dislike for the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_404">404</span>
city tendencies of Northern society. Among themselves
they were genial, reluctant to offend, and eager
to remove causes of offence. The domestic history
of the government at Washington repeated the Virginian
traits. Jefferson and his friends passed much
time in making quarrels, and more in making peace.
Unlike Pennsylvania, New York, and New England,
Virginia stood stoutly by her own leaders; and however
harsh Virginians might be in their judgment of
others, they carried delicacy to an extreme in their
treatment of each other. Even John Randolph and
W.&nbsp;B. Giles, who seemed to put themselves beyond
the social pale, were treated with tenderness and
regarded with admiration.</p>

<p>The appearance of a rough and harshly speaking
friend in such a society was no slight shock, and for
that reason William Henry Crawford was regarded
with some alarm; but Crawford was socially one of
themselves, while Armstrong belonged to a different
type and class. The faculty of doing a harsh act in
a harsh way, and of expressing rough opinions in a
caustic tone, was not what the Virginians most disliked
in Armstrong. His chief fault in their eyes,
and one which they could not be blamed for resenting,
was his avowed want of admiration for the Virginians
themselves. Armstrong’s opinion on that subject,
which was but the universal opinion of New
York politicians, became notorious long before he entered
the Cabinet, and even then annoyed Madison.<a id="FNanchor_494" href="#Footnote_494" class="fnanchor">494</a><span class="pagenum" id="Page_405">405</span>
The newspapers gossiped about the mean estimate
which Armstrong expressed for the capacities of the
Virginia statesmen. So old and fixed was the feud,
that from the first the Virginians lost no opportunity
to express their opinion of Armstrong, especially
in the Senate, whenever he was nominated for office.
Madison unwillingly selected him for the post of
secretary after Crawford refused it, but neither of
the Virginia senators voted on the question of confirmation.
In appointing Armstrong, Madison bestowed
on him neither respect nor confidence. He
afterward declared the reasons that caused him to
invite a person whom he distrusted into a position
of the highest importance.</p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“Should it be asked,” wrote Madison ten years after
the war,<a id="FNanchor_495" href="#Footnote_495" class="fnanchor">495</a> “why the individual in question was placed,
and after such developments of his career continued, at
the head of the War Department, the answer will readily
occur to those best acquainted with the circumstances of
the period. Others may be referred for an explanation
to the difficulty, which had been felt in its fullest pressure,
of obtaining services which would have been preferred,
several eminent citizens to whom the station had
been offered having successively declined it. It was not
unknown at the time that objections existed to the person
finally appointed, as appeared when his nomination went
to the Senate, where it received the reluctant sanction of
a scanty majority [eighteen to fifteen]. Nor was the
President unaware or unwarned of the temper and turn
of mind ascribed to him, which might be uncongenial<span class="pagenum" id="Page_406">406</span>
with the official relations in which he was to stand. But
these considerations were sacrificed to recommendations
from esteemed friends; a belief that he possessed, with
known talents, a degree of military information which
might be useful; and a hope that a proper mixture of
conciliating confidence and interposing control would
render objectionable peculiarities less in practice than
in prospect.”</p>
</div>

<p>Possibly Armstrong took a different view of Madison’s
conduct, and regarded his own acceptance of
the War Department in January, 1813, as proof both
of courage and disinterestedness. He knew that he
could expect no confidence from Virginians; but apparently
he cared little for Virginian enmity, and was
chiefly fretted by what he thought Virginian incompetence.
No one could fail to see that he came into
the Government rather as a master than a servant.
According to General Wilkinson, he was quite as
much feared as hated. “I am indeed shocked,”
wrote Wilkinson in his Memoirs,<a id="FNanchor_496" href="#Footnote_496" class="fnanchor">496</a> “when I take
a retrospect of the evidence of the terror in which
that minister kept more than one great man at Washington.”
Wilkinson, who hated Madison even more
than he hated Armstrong, evidently believed that the
President was afraid of his secretary. Madison himself
explained that he thought it better to bear with
Armstrong’s faults than to risk another change in
the Department of War.</p>

<p>In that decision Madison was doubtless right.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_407">407</span>
Whatever were Armstrong’s faults, he was the strongest
Secretary of War the government had yet seen.
Hampered by an inheritance of mistakes not easily
corrected, and by a chief whose methods were unmilitary
in the extreme, Armstrong still introduced
into the army an energy wholly new. Before he
had been a year in office he swept away the old generals
with whom Madison and Eustis had encumbered
the service, and in their place substituted new men.
While Major-Generals Dearborn, Pinckney, and Morgan
Lewis were set over military districts where active
service was unnecessary, and while Major-General
Wilkinson was summoned to the last of his many
courts of inquiry, the President sent to the Senate,
January 21 and February 21, the names of two new
major-generals and six brigadiers of a totally different
character from the earlier appointments.</p>

<p>The first major-general was George Izard of South
Carolina, born at Paris in 1777, his father Ralph
Izard being then American commissioner with Franklin
and Deane. Returning to America only for a few
years after the peace, George Izard at the age of fifteen
was sent abroad to receive a military education in
England, Germany, and France in the great school of
the French Revolution. As far as education could
make generals, Izard was the most promising officer
in the United States service. Appointed in March,
1812, colonel of the Second Artillery, promoted to
brigadier in March, 1813, he served with credit under
Hampton at Chateaugay, and received his promotion<span class="pagenum" id="Page_408">408</span>
over the heads of Chandler, Boyd, and one or two
other brigadiers his seniors. He was intended to
succeed Hampton on Lake Champlain.</p>

<p>The second new major-general was Jacob Brown,
who after receiving the appointment of brigadier,
July 19, 1813, was suddenly promoted to major-general
at the same time with Izard. The selection was
the more remarkable because Brown had no military
education, and was taken directly from the militia.
Born in Pennsylvania in 1775 of Quaker parentage,
Brown began life as a schoolmaster. At the instance
of the Society of Friends, he taught their public school
in New York city for several years with credit.<a id="FNanchor_497" href="#Footnote_497" class="fnanchor">497</a> He
then bought a large tract of land near Sackett’s Harbor,
and in 1799 undertook to found a town of Brownville.
He soon became a leading citizen in that part
of New York, and in 1809 was appointed to the command
of a militia regiment. In 1811 he was made a
brigadier of militia, and at the beginning of the war
distinguished himself by activity and success at Ogdensburg.
His defence of Sackett’s Harbor in 1813
won him a brigade in the regular service, and his
share in Wilkinson’s descent of the St. Lawrence led
to his further promotion.</p>

<p>Wilkinson, who regarded Brown as one of his enemies,
declared that he knew not enough of military
duty to post the guards of his camp,<a id="FNanchor_498" href="#Footnote_498" class="fnanchor">498</a> and that he compelled
his battery to form in a hollow for the advantage<span class="pagenum" id="Page_409">409</span>
of elevating the pieces to fire at the opposite
heights.<a id="FNanchor_499" href="#Footnote_499" class="fnanchor">499</a> Winfield Scott, who was one of Brown’s
warmest friends, described him as full of zeal and
vigor, but not a technical soldier, and but little acquainted
with organization, tactics, police, and camp-duties
in general.<a id="FNanchor_500" href="#Footnote_500" class="fnanchor">500</a> The promotion of an officer so
inexperienced to the most important command on
the frontier, gave a measure of Armstrong’s boldness
and judgment.</p>

<p>The six new brigadiers were also well chosen. They
were Alexander Macomb, T.&nbsp;A. Smith, Daniel Bissell,
Edmund P. Gaines, Winfield Scott, and Eleazer W.
Ripley, all colonels of the regular army, selected for
their merits. Armstrong supplied Brown’s defects of
education by giving him the aid of Winfield Scott
and Ripley, who were sent to organize brigades at
Niagara.</p>

<p>The energy thus infused by Armstrong into the
regular army lasted for half a century; but perhaps
his abrupt methods were better shown in another instance,
which brought upon him the displeasure of the
President. Against Harrison, Armstrong from the
first entertained a prejudice. Believing him to be
weak and pretentious, the Secretary of War showed
the opinion by leaving him in nominal command in
the northwest, but sending all his troops in different
directions, without consulting him even in regard
to movements within his own military department.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_410">410</span>
Harrison, taking just offence, sent his resignation as
major-general, May 11, 1814, but at the same time
wrote to Governor Shelby of Kentucky a letter which
caused the governor to address to the President a remonstrance
against accepting the resignation.<a id="FNanchor_501" href="#Footnote_501" class="fnanchor">501</a></p>

<p>At that moment Armstrong and Madison were discussing
the means of promoting Andrew Jackson in
the regular service for his success in the Creek campaigns.
No commission higher than that of brigadier
was then at their disposal, and a commission as brigadier
was accordingly prepared for Jackson May 22,
with a brevet of major-general.<a id="FNanchor_502" href="#Footnote_502" class="fnanchor">502</a> Harrison’s resignation
had been received by Armstrong two days before
issuing Jackson’s brevet, and had been notified to the
President, who was then at Montpelier.<a id="FNanchor_503" href="#Footnote_503" class="fnanchor">503</a> The President
replied May 25, suggesting that in view of Harrison’s
resignation, the better way would be to send a
commission as major-general directly to Jackson:
“I suspend a final decision, however, till I see you,
which will be in two or three days after the arrival of
this.”<a id="FNanchor_504" href="#Footnote_504" class="fnanchor">504</a> No sooner did Armstrong receive the letter,
than without waiting for the President’s return he
wrote to Jackson, May 28: “Since the date of my
letter of the 24th Major-General Harrison has resigned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_411">411</span>
his commission in the army, and thus is created a
vacancy in that grade, which I hasten to fill with your
name.”<a id="FNanchor_505" href="#Footnote_505" class="fnanchor">505</a></p>

<p>Armstrong’s course was irregular, and his account
to Jackson of the circumstances was incorrect; for
Harrison’s resignation had been received before, not
after, Armstrong’s letter of the 24th. Madison believed
that Armstrong wished to appear as the source
of favor to the army. Armstrong attributed Madison’s
hesitation to the wish of Madison and Monroe
that Harrison, rather than Jackson, should take command
of Mobile and New Orleans.<a id="FNanchor_506" href="#Footnote_506" class="fnanchor">506</a> Both suspicions
might be wrong or right; but Armstrong’s conduct,
while betraying the first motive, suggested the fear
that the President might change his mind; and Harrison
believed that the President would have done
so, had not Armstrong’s abrupt action made it impossible.
“The President expressed his great regret,”
said Harrison’s biographer,<a id="FNanchor_507" href="#Footnote_507" class="fnanchor">507</a> “that the letter of Governor
Shelby had not been received earlier, as in that
case the valuable services of General Harrison would
have been preserved to the nation in the ensuing
campaign.”</p>

<p>Little as the President liked his Secretary of War,
his antipathy was mild when compared with that of
Monroe. The failure of the Canada campaign gave a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_412">412</span>
serious blow to Armstrong; but he had still recovered
Detroit, and was about to finish the Creek war. His
hold upon the army was becoming strong. His enemies
charged him with ambition; they said he was
systematically engaged in strengthening his influence
by seducing the young officers of talents into his personal
support, teaching them to look for appreciation
not to the President but to himself, and appointing to
office only his own tools, or the sons of influential
men. He was believed to favor a conscription, and
to aim at the position of lieutenant-general. These
stories were constantly brought to Monroe, and drove
him to a condition of mind only to be described as
rabid. He took the unusual step of communicating
them to the President,<a id="FNanchor_508" href="#Footnote_508" class="fnanchor">508</a> with confidential comments
that, if known to Armstrong, could hardly have failed
to break up the Cabinet.</p>

<p>“It is painful to me to make this communication to
you,” wrote the Secretary of State Dec. 27, 1813;<a id="FNanchor_509" href="#Footnote_509" class="fnanchor">509</a> “nor
should I do it if I did not most conscientiously believe
that this man, if continued in office, will ruin not you
and the Administration only, but the whole Republican
party and cause. He has already gone far to do it, and
it is my opinion, if he is not promptly removed, he will
soon accomplish it. Without repeating other objections
to him, if the above facts are true, ... he wants a
head fit for his station. Indolent except to improper
purposes, he is incapable of that combination and activity<span class="pagenum" id="Page_413">413</span>
which the times require. My advice to you, therefore,
is to remove him at once. The near prospect of a
conscription, adopted and acted on without your approbation
or knowledge, is a sufficient reason. The burning
of Newark, if done by his orders, is another. The
failure to place troops at Fort George is another. In
short there are abundant reasons for it. His removal
for either of the three would revive the hopes of our
party now desponding, and give a stimulus to measures.
I do not however wish you to act on my advice,—consult
any in whom you have confidence. Mr. A. has, as
you may see, few friends, and some of them cling to
him rather as I suspect from improper motives, or on
a presumption that you support him.”</p>
</div>

<p>Armstrong’s faults were beyond dispute, but his
abilities were very considerable; and the President
justly thought that nothing would be gained by dismissing
him, even to restore Monroe to the War Department.
Armstrong, struggling with the load of
incapable officers and insufficient means, for which
Madison and Congress were responsible, required the
firm support of his chief and his colleagues, as well
as of the army and of Congress, to carry the burden
of the war; but he had not a friend to depend upon.
Secretary Jones was as hostile as Monroe. Pennsylvania
and Virginia equally distrusted him, and the
fate of any public man distrusted by Pennsylvania
and Virginia was commonly fixed in advance. Armstrong
was allowed to continue his preparations for
the next campaign, but Monroe remained actively hostile.
In a private letter to Crawford, written probably<span class="pagenum" id="Page_414">414</span>
about the month of May, 1814, and preserved
with a memorandum that it was not sent, Monroe
<span class="locked">said:<a id="FNanchor_510" href="#Footnote_510" class="fnanchor">510</a>—</span></p>

<div class="blockquot">

<p>“There is now no officer free to command to whom
the public looks with any sort of confidence or even hope.
Izard stands next, but he is as you see otherwise engaged
[on a court of inquiry on Wilkinson]. Thus the
door is left open for some new pretender, and Mr.
Armstrong is that pretender. This has been his object
from the beginning.... The whole affair is beyond my
control.”</p>
</div>

<p>Thus the elements of confusion surrounding Armstrong
were many. A suspicious and hesitating
President; a powerful and jealous Secretary of State;
a South Carolinian major-general, educated in the
French engineers, commanding on Lake Champlain;
a Pennsylvania schoolmaster, of Quaker parentage,
without military knowledge, commanding at Sackett’s
Harbor and Niagara; a few young brigadiers eager
to distinguish themselves, and an army of some thirty
thousand men,—these were the elements with which
Armstrong was to face the whole military power of
England; for Paris capitulated March 31, and the
war in Europe was ended.</p>

<p>In one respect, Armstrong’s conduct seemed inconsistent
with the idea of selfishness or intrigue.
The duty of organizing a court martial for the trial
of William Hull fell necessarily upon him. Hull’s
defence must inevitably impeach Hull’s superiors;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_415">415</span>
his acquittal was possible only on the ground that the
Government had been criminally negligent in supporting
him. As far as Armstrong was interested
in the result, he was concerned in proving the incapacity
of his predecessor Eustis, and of the President,
in their management of the war. He could have had
no personal object to gain in procuring the conviction
of Hull, but he might defend his own course by
proving the imbecility of Dearborn.</p>

<p>The President ordered a court martial on Hull
before Armstrong entered the War Department. A.
J. Dallas drew up the specifications, and inserted,
contrary to his own judgment, a charge of treason
made by the Department. The other charges were
cowardice, neglect of duty, and unofficer-like conduct.
Monroe, while temporarily at the head of the Department,
organized the first court to meet at Philadelphia
Feb. 25, 1813. Major-General Wade Hampton
was to preside.</p>

<p>Before the trial could be held, Armstrong came
into office, and was obliged to order the members of
the court to active service. Hampton was sent to
Lake Champlain, and when his campaign ended in
November, 1813, he returned under charges resembling
those against Hull.<a id="FNanchor_511" href="#Footnote_511" class="fnanchor">511</a> Finding that neither Wilkinson
nor Armstrong cared to press them, and satisfied
that no inquiry could be impartial, Hampton<span class="pagenum" id="Page_416">416</span>
determined to settle the question by once more sending
in his resignation,<a id="FNanchor_512" href="#Footnote_512" class="fnanchor">512</a> which he did in March, 1814,
when it was accepted. Armstrong in effect acquitted
Hampton by accepting his resignation, and never publicly
affirmed any charge against him until after
Hampton’s death, when he attributed to the major-general
“much professional error and great moral
depravity.”<a id="FNanchor_513" href="#Footnote_513" class="fnanchor">513</a> Hampton’s opinion of Armstrong could
be gathered only from his conduct and his letters to
the Secretary of War, but was not materially different
from Armstrong’s opinion of Hampton.</p>

<p>Meanwhile Hull waited for trial. During the summer
of 1813 he saw nearly all his possible judges
disgraced and demanding courts martial like himself.
Hampton was one; Wilkinson another; Dearborn a
third. Dearborn had been removed from command
of his army in face of the enemy, and loudly called
for a court of inquiry. Instead of granting the request,
the President again assigned him to duty in
command of Military District No. 3, comprising the
city of New York, and also made him President of
the court martial upon General Hull.</p>

<p>The impropriety of such a selection could not be
denied. Of all men in the United States, Dearborn
was most deeply interested in the result of Hull’s
trial, and the President, next to Dearborn, would be
most deeply injured by Hull’s acquittal. The judgment<span class="pagenum" id="Page_417">417</span>
of Dearborn, or of any court over which Dearborn
presided, in a matter which affected both court
and government so closely could not command respect.
That Armstrong lent himself to such a measure
was a new trait of character never explained; but
that Madison either ordered or permitted it showed
that he must have been unconscious either of Dearborn’s
responsibility for Hull’s disaster, or of his
own.</p>

<p>Hull offered no objection to his court, and the trial
began at Albany, Jan. 3, 1814, Dearborn presiding,
and Martin Van Buren acting as special judge-advocate.
March 26 the court sentenced Hull to be shot
to death for cowardice, neglect of duty, and unofficer-like
conduct. April 25 President Madison approved
the sentence, but remitted the execution, and Hull’s
name was ordered to be struck from the army roll.</p>

<p>That some one should be punished for the loss of
Detroit was evident, and few persons were likely to
complain because Hull was a selected victim; but
many thought that if Hull deserved to be shot, other
men, much higher than he in office and responsibility,
merited punishment; and the character of the
court-martial added no credit to the Government,
which in effect it acquitted of blame.</p>

<p>Punctuation, hyphenation, and spelling were made
consistent when a predominant preference was found
in the original book; otherwise they were not changed.</p>

<p>Simple typographical errors were corrected; unbalanced
quotation marks were remedied when the change was
obvious, and otherwise left unbalanced.</p>

<p>Illustrations in this eBook have been positioned
between paragraphs and outside quotations.</p>

<p>Footnotes, originally at the bottoms of pages, have been collected,
renumbered, and placed near the end of this eBook.</p>

<p>The Title Page and Table of Contents indicate
that this is Volume I, but that refers to its
position in the “Second Administration of
James Madison” subset of the full “History”.
In that nine-volume “History”, this is
Volume&nbsp;VII.
